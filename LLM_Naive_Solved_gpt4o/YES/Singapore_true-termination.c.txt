=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The condition `x + y <= 0` with the loop `x = x + x + y; y = y - 1;` allows for non-terminating behavior. Specifically, `x` can increase indefinitely when `x > 0` and `y` is decreasing, while their sum remains initially nonpositive, leading to an endless loop.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The value of `x` can increase indefinitely when `x > 0` and `x + y <= 0`, causing the loop to run indefinitely without a terminating condition.
