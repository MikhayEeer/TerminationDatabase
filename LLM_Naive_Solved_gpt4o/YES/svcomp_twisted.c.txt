=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program contains a pair of mutually recursive loops (L1 and L2) with `goto` statements causing it to loop indefinitely under certain conditions. Specifically, if both `k` and `l` are positive, the function enters an infinite loop without any guaranteed exit, depending on how `i` increments and the modulo operation outcome.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program contains mutual dependence between the loops L1 and L2, with infinite redirections possible due to the `goto` statements based on the values of `i`. If `k` and `l` are both sufficiently large, the program does not guarantee progression out of both loops, leading to potential non-termination.
