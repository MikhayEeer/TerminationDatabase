=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The outer loop will never terminate because `x` is incremented by 1 and then decremented by 2, leading to a net decrease of 1. However, whenever `x` becomes non-positive, the first iteration increments `x` back to a non-negative value, thereby repeating indefinitely.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The outer loop increments `x` by 1 and decrements it by 2 in each iteration, ensuring that `x` will always eventually become negative and terminate the loop. However, since `x` is incremented at the start of the loop and `x >= 0` is checked, this results in an endless cycle of the outer loop, allowing the potentially infinite execution without ever terminating.
