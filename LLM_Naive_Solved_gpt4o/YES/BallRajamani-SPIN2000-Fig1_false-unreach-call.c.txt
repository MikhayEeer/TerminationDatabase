=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program uses recursive calls in function `A` with the same parameters, leading to potential infinite recursion without a base case that guarantees termination.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The function `A` calls itself recursively with swapped parameters, potentially leading to infinite recursion if `a1` remains non-zero. Additionally, the assignment in `main()` ensures `g` can be non-zero after function `A` is called, leading to a potential infinite loop in the system's state.
