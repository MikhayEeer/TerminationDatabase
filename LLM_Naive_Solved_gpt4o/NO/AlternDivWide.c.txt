1. If i < -w: -i^2  
2. If -w <= i <= w: constant function (0)  
3. If i > w: -i^2

Explanation: In the given program, the main while loop continues until `i` is not equal to zero. Within the loop, there are three conditions:

1. If `i` is less than `-w`, `i` is decreased by 1 and then its sign is changed, effectively increasing `i` towards zero in absolute value, thus helping in reducing the distance to the termination condition (`i != 0`).

2. If `i` is within the range `[-w, w]`, `i` is set to zero, causing the termination of the loop.

3. If `i` is greater than `w`, `i` is increased by 1 and then its sign is changed, effectively decreasing `i` towards zero in absolute value, thus aiding in reaching the termination condition.

Thus, each transition in these conditions results in reaching the termination condition, and the given piecewise ranking function demonstrates the termination.

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
- For `i < -w`: the ranking function is `-i`, which is strictly decreasing because each iteration decreases `i` by 1 and then flips its sign.
- For `i > w`: the ranking function is `i`, which is strictly decreasing because each iteration increases `i` by 1 and then flips its sign.
- For `-w ≤ i ≤ w`: the program sets `i` to 0 and exits the loop, ensuring termination. 

This demonstrates termination because, in every case, the value of `i` is moved closer to 0, effectively exiting the loop.
