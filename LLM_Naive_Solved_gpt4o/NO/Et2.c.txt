[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * b^1 + 0.0 * 1

This program terminates because with each iteration of the while loop, the variable `b` is decremented by at least 1 due to the `a - 1 - r` value assigned to both `b` and `a`, where `r` can be at minimum 0. When `b` becomes non-positive, the loop condition `b > 0` will be false, causing the loop to stop. The ranking function `1.0 * b^1` shows that `b` strictly decreases towards zero or a negative value, leading to termination.
