=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
6 - i2

The program is terminating because of the loop variable `i2`, which is incremented in each iteration and limits the loop to run a maximum of 6 times (from 0 to 5). This can be represented by a simple linear ranking function `6 - i2`, which decreases in every iteration.
