phase 1: (|i| > 5)  
     f(i, w) = |i|  
phase 2: (-5 <= i <= 5)  
     f(i) = i  

This program can be shown to terminate using a multi-phase ranking function. In the first phase, when |i| is greater than 5, the absolute value of i is reduced in every iteration of the loop. Once i is within the range [-5, 5], the second phase ensures that eventually i is set to 0, terminating the loop.
