if (-5 <= x && x <= 0) then f(x) = -5 - x  
if (0 < x <= 30) then f(x) = x  
if (30 < x <= 35) then f(x) = 35 - x  
if (x < -5 OR x > 35) then f(x) = |x|  

Explanation:  
The program is structured such that when `x` is within the range of -5 to 35, the program sets `x` to 0 eventually, which results in the termination of the while loop. Each branch in the program systematically reduces the distance of `x` from reaching zero based on its initial value. Outside these bounds (`x < -5 OR x > 35`), the program sets `x` to 0 immediately. This ensures termination from any starting value of `x.`

1. If \(-5 \leq x \leq 35\) and \(x \neq 0\): \(-x + c\), where \(c\) is a constant large enough to cover the initial range.  
2. If \(x < -5\) or \(x > 35\), \(x\) is set to 0, and thus terminates immediately.  

This piecewise ranking function demonstrates that the program will eventually reach a state where the loop condition \(x \neq 0\) is false, hence proving termination.
