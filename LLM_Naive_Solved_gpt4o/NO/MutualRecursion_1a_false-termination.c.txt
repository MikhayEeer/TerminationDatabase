For function `f(x)`:  
   Piecewise Ranking Function:  
   - If `x <= 0`, the function returns 0, treated as a terminal case.  
   - If `x > 0`, it calls `g(x)` and `g(x + 1)`, where each decrease `x` until reaching terminal cases for `g`.  

For function `g(x)`:
   Piecewise Ranking Function:  
   - If `x <= 0`, the function returns 0, treated as a terminal case.  
   - If `x > 0`, it calls `f(x - 1)` and `f(x - 2)`, where each decrease `x` until reaching terminal cases for `f`.  

The mutually recursive decreasing argument `x` in both functions ensures the termination, as each step of recursion effectively reduces the problem size.

[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
g:  
1.0 * x^2 + 1.0 * 1  
f:  
1.0 * x^2 + 1.0 * 1  

Explanation: The mutual recursion between functions `f` and `g` ensures that the value of `x` decreases over each call. In both functions, any non-terminal call reduces the argument by at least 1 in one of the recursive calls due to the operations `g(x - 1)` and `f(x - 2)`. This guarantees that the recursion will eventually terminate when `x` becomes less than or equal to 0. The multi-phase ranking function uses `x^2` to demonstrate this termination behavior as it guarantees the potential function strictly decreases during recursive calls.
