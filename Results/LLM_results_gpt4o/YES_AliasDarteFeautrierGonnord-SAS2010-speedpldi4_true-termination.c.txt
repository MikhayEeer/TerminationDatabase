[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * i^1 when i < m  
1.0 * (i / m)^1 when i >= m  

The program is terminating, and the termination is shown by a piecewise ranking function. The function decreases in each path: `i` decreases directly when `i < m` and decreases in terms of the number of times to subtract `m` from `i` when `i >= m`.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
piecewise  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
- For the path where `i < m`:  
  Linear ranking function: `i^1`  
- For the path where `i >= m`:  
  Linear ranking function: `floor(i / m)^1`  

The program is terminating as it enters a loop that decrements `i`. When `i < m`, it decrements by 1, and when `i >= m`, it decrements by `m`. Since `m` is positive and `n > m`, `i` will eventually decrease to 0, ensuring termination.
