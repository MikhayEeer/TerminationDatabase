[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * x^1  
y^1 + 0.5 * y^0  

Explanation:
The given program will terminate because the value of `x` is updated from `x` to `y` in each iteration, and `y` is decremented by 1 in each iteration. This causes `x` to eventually become non-positive, fulfilling the termination condition of the loop `x > 0`. With each loop iteration, `y` reduces, leading both variables toward the loop's exit condition. The ranking function for this non-linear pattern employs a multi-phase method, first decreasing `x` towards zero and then reducing `y`.
