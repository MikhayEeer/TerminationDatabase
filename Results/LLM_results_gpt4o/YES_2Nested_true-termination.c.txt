f_0(x, y) = y + 1
f_1(x, y) = x

The given program is terminating. It can be proven using a nested ranking function where the primary ranking function \( f_0(x, y) = y + 1 \) decreases when \( y \) decreases, and subsequently, the secondary ranking function \( f_1(x, y) = x \) handles the case when \( y \) has reached its lower bound. Therefore, the loop will eventually terminate as \( x \) decreases unconditionally when \( y \leq 0 \).
