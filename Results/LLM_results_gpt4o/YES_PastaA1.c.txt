nested
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
Primary: f(x) = x
Secondary: g(y) = x - y

Explanation: The outer loop decreases `x` from its initial value, down to 0. The inner loop increments `y` from 0 to `x`, ensuring it always terminates for each iteration of the outer loop. The nested ranking functions provide a clear measure that decreases overall as the loops execute, proving termination.
