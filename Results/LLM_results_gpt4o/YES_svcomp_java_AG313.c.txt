[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
x + y - 1

The function `quot` will terminate as long as both `x` and `y` are positive integers and `x` is not initially zero (as it returns immediately in that case). The loop decreases `x` and `y` in each iteration, and the linear ranking function `x + y - 1` decreases by 1 each time, ensuring termination when it becomes non-positive.
