For the outer loop:
1.0 * x + 1.0 * y

For the inner loops:
1.0 * x (when x > y)
1.0 * y (when y >= x)

The program will definitely terminate because each loop strictly reduces the value of x or y, eventually leading the loop conditions to become false.

1.  x^1 for the outer loop  
2.  x^1 for the inner loop if x > y  
3.  y^1 for the inner loop if x <= y  

The outer loop decreases because either `x` or `y` will eventually reach zero, at which point the outer loop condition `(x > 0) && (y > 0)` will fail. For the inner loops, `x` and `y` are strictly decreased in every iteration until they reach zero. Thus, the program will terminate.
