[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
The program has a non-linear ranking function derived from the expression:  
0.5 * x^2 + y * x  

This is a non-linear expression that strictly decreases in every loop iteration. Since `x` is decreasing by `2*y` and `y` is incremented in each iteration, the value 0.5 * x^2 + y * x strictly decreases until the loop condition `x > 0` is not satisfied, hence proving termination.
