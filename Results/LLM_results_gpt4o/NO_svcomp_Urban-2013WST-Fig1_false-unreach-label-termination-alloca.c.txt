=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program enters an infinite loop when *x > 6, as the value of *x continuously increases by 2, maintaining *x <= 10 and thus the loop never exits.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The value of *x is increased by 2 when it is greater than 6, creating an endless loop when initially greater than 6, as there is no mechanism to break it.
