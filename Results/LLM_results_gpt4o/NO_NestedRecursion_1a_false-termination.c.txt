=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The mutual recursion between `rec1` and `rec2` does not guarantee termination. The deeply nested calls and the combination of decrement and increment operations may result in infinite recursion depending on the value of `x`.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The recursion in the functions `rec1` and `rec2` can repeatedly invoke each other in a manner that leads to infinite recursion without reaching a base condition. Specifically, `rec2` calls `rec1` with `j+1`, and `rec1` may call `rec1` again with an argument larger than its base case allows to terminate, creating a non-terminating cycle.
