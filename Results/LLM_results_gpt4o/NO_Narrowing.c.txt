=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program can get stuck in an infinite loop oscillating between increasing and decreasing `i` within the modified `range`, especially when `range` is decreased and `i` stays between `0` and the new `range`. The oscillation occurs indefinitely without reaching an exit condition.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program enters an infinite loop where the variable `i` oscillates between `0` and a decreasing `range`. When `i` reaches `range-2`, the `range` decreases by 1, but this operation does not lead to a state where the loop condition `0 <= i && i <= range` becomes false. This causes the loop to potentially continue indefinitely without termination.
