[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * (x - y)^1 + 1.0 * 1  
1.0 * tx^1 + 1.0 * 1  

The program terminates because the variable `x - y` decreases with each iteration of the loop, and `tx` is non-negative and decreases to negative, ensuring the loop condition eventually fails.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program may not terminate if `x` is significantly larger than `y` and updates to `x` and `y` are balanced such that `x >= y` holds indefinitely.
