=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program contains an infinite `while (true)` loop that does not have any terminating condition or mechanism to exit the loop. The values of `i` and `j` are always incremented, preventing the loop from reaching a halting state.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The loop runs indefinitely as the condition is always true and there is no mechanism within the loop that can break or exit it.
