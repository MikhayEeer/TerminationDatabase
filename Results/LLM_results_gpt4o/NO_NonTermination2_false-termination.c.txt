=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program contains an infinite loop scenario where `x` can be set to values greater than or equal to `2*old_x` indefinitely by the nondeterministic assignment, which prevents termination by avoiding the break condition.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program can enter an infinite loop if `__VERIFIER_nondet_int()` repeatedly returns values greater than `1` without satisfying the break condition `x < 2*old_x`.
