=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The value of `y` does not decrease due to integer division rounding. If `y` starts within the range 0 <= y <= 10, `(2*y + 1) / 2` evaluates to `y`, creating an infinite loop.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
For values of y such that 0 <= y <= 10, the expression (2*y + 1) / 2 results in y itself because of integer division rounding, maintaining the loop invariant and leading to an infinite loop.
