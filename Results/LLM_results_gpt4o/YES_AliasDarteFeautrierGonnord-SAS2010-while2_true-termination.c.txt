Explanation: The outer loop decreases `i` on each iteration, and the inner loop decreases `j`. For each increment of the outer loop where `i` is decremented, the inner loop always completes before returning control back to the outer loop. The ranking functions provided, correspondingly, are: `1.0 * i + 0.0` for the outer loop phase and `1.0 * j + 0.0` for the inner loop phase. Both ranking functions are linear and guarantee eventual termination to zero within their respective loops when they become non-positive, ensuring the whole program terminates.

The program terminates because it consists of two nested loops. The outer loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which decreases by 1 in each iteration and is initialized to `N`, eventually reaching 0. The inner loop is controlled by the variable `j`, which decreases by 1 in each iteration and is re-initialized to `N` on each iteration of the outer loop. This structure ensures that both loops will terminate after a finite number of steps.
