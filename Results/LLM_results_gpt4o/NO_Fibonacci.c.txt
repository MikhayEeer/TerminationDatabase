=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program computes Fibonacci numbers in the `j` variable. If `n` is a Fibonacci number not equal to 1, the loop will never terminate as `j` will increment past `n` in Fibonacci steps.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The loop updates variables `i` and `j` according to the Fibonacci sequence, with the condition that it continues as long as `j` is not equal to `n`. If `n` is a Fibonacci number, `j` will eventually equal `n`, terminating the loop. However, for non-Fibonacci values of `n` (especially if `n` is negative or zero but not initially assigned to `j`), the loop condition `j != n` will never be satisfied, making the program potentially non-terminating in those cases.
