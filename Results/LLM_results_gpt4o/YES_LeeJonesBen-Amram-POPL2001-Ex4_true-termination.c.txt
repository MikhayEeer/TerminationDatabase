[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * r^1 + 0.0 * n^1 + 0.0 * m^1  
1.0 * n^1 + 0.0 * m^1 + 0.0 * r^1  

The function `p` is terminating because it uses a multi-phase ranking where in the first phase, the value of `r` decreases until it reaches zero while `n` and `m` remain unchanged. In the second phase, after `r` reaches zero, the value of `n` decreases. Each phase of decreasing non-negative integers ensures the termination of the function under the given conditions.
