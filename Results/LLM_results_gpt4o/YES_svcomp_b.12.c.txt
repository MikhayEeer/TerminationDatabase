[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * x^1 + 0.0 * y^1  
1.0 * y^1  

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
x + y

The program is terminating because the linear ranking function \(x + y\) decreases by 1 in each iteration of the while loop, and the loop condition \((x > 0) || (y > 0)\) eventually becomes false when both \(x\) and \(y\) reach 0.
