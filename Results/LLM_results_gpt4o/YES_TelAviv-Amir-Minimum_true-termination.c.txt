=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
piecewise
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
min(x, y) - 1

The program terminates because in each iteration of the while loop, at least one of the variables `x` or `y` is decremented based on the condition provided, guaranteeing that the minimum of the two variables keeps decreasing and eventually reaches a non-positive value, terminating the loop. The ranking function `min(x, y) - 1` effectively ensures that the loop makes progress towards termination.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
piecewise
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
min(x, y) - 1

This program is terminating because the value of both `x` and `y` decrease toward 0 in each loop iteration, with the minimum of `x` and `y` being chosen and decremented. This ensures termination as `min(x, y)` is strictly decreasing and serves as a ranking function.
