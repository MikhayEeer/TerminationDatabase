[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
For outer loop:
10 - x1

For inner loop:
x2 - 1

The program is designed with nested loops: the outer loop runs while `x1 <= 10`, incrementing `x1` by 1 in each iteration, and the inner loop, which resets `x2` to 1000, decrements `x2` until it is less than or equal to 1. The outer loop terminates when `x1` exceeds 10, and the inner loop decreases `x2` until it reaches 1, so both loops are ensured to terminate via their respective ranking functions. The use of piecewise ranking functions here captures this nested loop structure.

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1. A linear ranking function for the inner loop: \( f_1(x2) = x2 \)  
2. A linear ranking function for the outer loop: \( f_2(x1) = 10 - x1 \)  

The program is terminating because the outer loop increases `x1` in each iteration and stops when `x1` surpasses 10. For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop decreases `x2` from 1000 to 1, ensuring it terminates. The termination of both loops can be proven using the given piecewise linear ranking functions.
