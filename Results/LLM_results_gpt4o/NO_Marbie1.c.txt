=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The value of `i` is increased by 1 in each iteration of the loop, and since `i` starts greater than 2, it will never satisfy the termination condition `i <= 2`.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The loop incrementally increases `i`, which starts with a value greater than 2, leading to an infinite loop.
