=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program is non-terminating for initial values such as `x=1` and `y=0`, as `x > 0` remains true indefinitely with the updates `x = x + y` (where `x` stays at 1) and `y = -2*y` which keeps `y` as 0.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program is non-terminating for the initial values of x=1 and y=0. The loop condition `x > 0` remains true, and the loop updates `x` to `x + y = 1 + 0 = 1` and `y` to `-2 * y = -2 * 0 = 0`, resulting in no change. This cycle continues indefinitely, thus making the program non-terminating.
