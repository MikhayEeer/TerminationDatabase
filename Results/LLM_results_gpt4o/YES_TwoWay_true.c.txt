=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
In the `twoWay` function, the value of `n` can be modified either by incrementing or decrementing depending on the `terminate` flag. If `terminate` is `false`, `m` increments leading to potential unbounded growth, thus causing infinite recursion if starting from a non-negative `n`. The growth or reduction determined by the parameters can result in non-termination, especially due to the recursive call `twoWay(terminate, m)` without a guaranteed base case leading to termination in all scenarios.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The function `twoWay` can be recursively invoked with arguments that do not guarantee termination. Specifically, when the function is called with `terminate` set to `false`, the local variable `m` is incremented, potentially leading to an infinite recursion if the base case `n < 0` is never reached. This introduces an unbounded increase, preventing the termination guarantee.
