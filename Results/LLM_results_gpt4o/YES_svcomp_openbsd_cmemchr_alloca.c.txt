n

The program is terminating. The function `cmemchr` takes a pointer and iterates over up to `n` characters looking for a match. The loop decrements `n` each time until `n` is zero. By ensuring that `n` is at least 1, it will always terminate after exhausting all `n` characters or finding a match, and cannot run indefinitely. This is proven by the linear ranking function `n`, which strictly decreases with each iteration and assures termination.

multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * n^1  

Explanation: The main loop within the `cmemchr` function iterates with the condition `n != 0` and decrements `n` in each iteration with the statement `--n`. This ensures that the number of iterations is limited by the initial value of `n` which is constrained to be at least 1. Therefore, the function terminates as it will eventually reach a state where `n` is 0, exiting the loop. The program is thus proved to be terminating using the ranking function `1.0 * n^1`.
