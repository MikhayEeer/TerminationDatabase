=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The loop `while (i >= 0)` allows for non-deterministic choices for `i`. Even if `i` becomes negative, a later iteration might set `i` to a non-negative value again, potentially causing the loop to iterate indefinitely. Thus, there is no guarantee that the loop will terminate.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The value of `i` can remain non-negative indefinitely as it is assigned a nondeterministic value within the loop, making the loop potentially infinite.
