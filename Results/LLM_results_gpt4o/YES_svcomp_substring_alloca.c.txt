- The outer while loop at `char *ps = s; while (*ps != '\0')` 
  - Ranking function: `|nondetString1 - ps|`
  - The ranking function decreases by 1 for each iteration, and it terminates when `ps` reaches the end of `nondetString1` as the null character `'\0'` is found.

- The inner while loop at `char *pt = t; while (*pt != '\0' && *pt == *ps2)`
  - Occurs at most `|nondetString2|` times, as `pt` moves forward through `nondetString2`.
  - The ranking function: `|nondetString2 - pt|`
  - This loop terminates when a mismatch occurs or the end of `nondetString2` is reached, as indicated by `pt` reaching `'\0'`.

These ranking functions demonstrate termination for both nested loops under the condition that both strings end with a null character, which adheres to the C string convention and is explicitly ensured in the program.

The function `substring` involves two nested loops. Each time the outer loop progresses (`ps` increments), the inner loop is expected to finish if `*pt` reaches the end (`'\0'`). The inner loop only advances when characters match, and it guarantees to exit once `*pt != '\0'` is false. Since each loop condition involves finite traversal through null-terminated strings and the pointers `ps` and `ps2` advance towards `'\0'`, the function will terminate after a finite number of steps given valid input strings (`nondetString1` and `nondetString2` being properly null-terminated).

The termination can be argued by considering:
1. The length of the outer loop controlled by `ps`, which is bound by the length of `nondetString1` (say `n1`).
2. The length of the inner loop controlled by `pt`, which is bound by the length of `nondetString2` (say `n2`).

Multi-phase ranking function:
- Phase 1: The number of positions `ps` needs to increment before the outer loop stops: `n1`.
- Phase 2: For each step in Phase 1, how `pt` (and `ps2` which shadows `ps`) increments until null termination in the inner loop for each prefix from `ps`: At most `n2` steps.

Each phase guarantees decrement in available steps leading towards null-terminated string positions ensuring loop progress, hence confirming termination.
