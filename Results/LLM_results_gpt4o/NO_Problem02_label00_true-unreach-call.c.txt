=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program has infinite loop potential in the main function, which continuously reads input and calls `calculate_output` without any exit condition, conditional break, or return mechanism from the loop once it starts. The only termination would occur via the `exit(0)` functionality within the `calculate_output` function when certain conditions are met, but these branches are not guaranteed to be reached depending on the sequence of inputs. This lack of guaranteed reaching of exit conditions implies potential non-termination for certain input patterns.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program contains an infinite loop `while(1)` without any break or exit condition that guarantees termination. The `calculate_output` function also includes conditional branches that lead to an infinite loop without modifying any loop-invariant condition to eventually exit the loop, along with potential nondeterminism from input which does not guarantee reaching any of the exit conditions.
