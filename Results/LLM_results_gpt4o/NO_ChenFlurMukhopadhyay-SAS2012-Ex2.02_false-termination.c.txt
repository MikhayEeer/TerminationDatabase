=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program can enter an infinite loop if \( x \) is initially negative and \( y \) is zero. The loop condition \( x < 0 \) will keep holding as \( y \) does not affect \( x \) in a way that ensures it becomes non-negative.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program is non-terminating if `x < 0` and `y` is a positive integer initially. In this case, the increments of `x` by `y` and the decrement of `y` will eventually lead `y` to become zero or negative while `x` remains negative, thus trapping the loop in an endless cycle without reaching the exit condition.
