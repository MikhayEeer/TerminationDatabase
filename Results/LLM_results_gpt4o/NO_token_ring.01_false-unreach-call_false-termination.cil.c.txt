=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program uses multiple unbounded nondeterministic inputs (`__VERIFIER_nondet_int()`) affecting control flow, especially in `master()` and `transmit1()` functions, causing potential infinite loops.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program contains infinite loops, specifically in the `master` and `transmit1` functions, which do not have any conditions to terminate these loops. Additionally, there are no exit conditions in the main evaluation loop (`eval`) or during the whole simulation process (`start_simulation`). Without specific conditions to break out of these loops or modify variables that influence termination, the program is non-terminating.
