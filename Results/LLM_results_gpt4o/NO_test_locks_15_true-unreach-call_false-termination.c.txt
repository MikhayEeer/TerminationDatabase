=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program contains an infinite loop with a condition based on a nondeterministic integer `cond` that, if always non-zero, makes the loop never break out. Hence, the program may execute indefinitely depending on the values returned by `__VERIFIER_nondet_int()` for `cond`.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program contains an infinite loop with an unconstrained nondeterministic condition `cond` that either ends the loop or continues indefinitely. If `cond` never reaches 0, the loop can run indefinitely, leading to non-termination.
