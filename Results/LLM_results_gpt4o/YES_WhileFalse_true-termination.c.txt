=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
constant
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
f(x) = 0

Explanation: The loop condition is equivalent to `false`, meaning the loop does not execute. Hence, the program terminates immediately, and a constant ranking function `f(x) = 0` confirms termination.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
f(x) = 0

Explanation: The loop condition `while (0)` is always false, so the loop body will never be executed. The program terminates immediately. The ranking function f(x) = 0 is valid and proves termination in this trivial case.
