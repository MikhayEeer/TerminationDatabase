=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program contains a loop where the values of `i` and `j` are swapped continuously whenever both are non-zero. If `i` and `j` are initialized to be non-zero values and never become zero during swapping, the loop will continue indefinitely, resulting in non-termination.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program exhibits a swapping behavior where 'i' and 'j' continuously exchange values without a condition that ensures either variable is decreased towards zero. If 'i' and 'j' are initialized with non-zero values and are non-zero when the loop is reached, they will keep swapping indefinitely, leading to non-termination.
