=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The variables `x`, `y`, and `z` increase in a way that can lead to `x` never reaching a non-positive value, creating the possibility of an infinite loop.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` can increase indefinitely inside the loop, causing `x` to remain greater than zero and the loop to never terminate.
