[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
For `fact(int x)` function:
- Ranking function: \( f(x) = x \)
  
Explanation:  
The function `fact(x)` is recursively calling itself with a strictly decreasing argument. Each recursive call reduces the value of `x` by 1, and the recursion stops when `x <= 1`. Therefore, the recursion is bounded by the value `1`, ensuring that it terminates.

In the `main` function, the checks to return early if `x` or `y` are negative prevent non-termination due to undefined behavior in the recursion. The `fact` function will always be called with a non-negative value due to those checks, ensuring termination. The value `z` does not affect termination because it is not used in the recursion or any loops.
