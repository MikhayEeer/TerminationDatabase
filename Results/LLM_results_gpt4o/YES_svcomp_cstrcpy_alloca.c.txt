[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
The function `cstrcpy()` has a linear ranking function based on the length of `src`. Each iteration of the loop copies one character until a null-terminator (`'\0'`) is encountered, reducing the remaining length of `src` to be copied by one in each iteration. This guarantees termination when a valid null-terminated string is present in `src`.
