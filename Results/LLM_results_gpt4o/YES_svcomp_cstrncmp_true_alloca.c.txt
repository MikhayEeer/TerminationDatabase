[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
The ranking function for this program depends on the input `n` and reduces the value of `n` by 1 in each iteration of the loop within the `cstrncmp` function. Therefore, a potential ranking function is as follows:  
1. `n`  

Explanation:  
- The function `cstrncmp` compares the strings `s1` and `s2` up to `n` characters.  
- On each iteration, `n` is decremented by 1 until it reaches 0 or a difference between the characters is found.  
- This results in a strictly decreasing value for `n`, ensuring that the program will eventually terminate.
