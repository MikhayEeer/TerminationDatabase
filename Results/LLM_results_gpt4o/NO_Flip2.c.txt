=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program can exhibit infinite behavior when `i` and `j` are initialized to any positive number, satisfying `i == j`. In each iteration, `i` is decremented by 1 while `j` remains unchanged, leading to an infinite loop since `i` can continue decrementing indefinitely without reaching zero.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
i^1 + j^1
