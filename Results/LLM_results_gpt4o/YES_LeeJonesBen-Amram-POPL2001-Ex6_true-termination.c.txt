1.0 * b^1 + 1.0 * 1
0.5 * c^1 + 0.5 * 1

This program is terminating with a multi-phase ranking function. In the `f` function, the value of `b` determines the termination of the first phase as it's decremented each recursive call until it reaches zero. In the `g` function, the value of `c` determines the termination of the second phase as it's decremented each recursive call until it reaches zero.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
Phase 1: \( b \) (in function \( f \))
Phase 2: \( c \) (in function \( g \))

[EXPLANATION]
The function `f(a, b)` decreases the argument `b` in every recursive call until `b` reaches 0, at which point the control transfers to `g(a, 0)`. 

In the function `g(c, d)`, the argument `c` decreases by 1 in each call until it reaches 0. The value of `d` is non-decreasing, but it does not affect the termination as the primary guide to termination is the decrease of `c`.

Each phase has a strictly decreasing parameter (`b` in `f` and `c` in `g`) bounded by the initial values from the main function. Since both functions have finite recursion steps, the overall program terminates.
