=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The loop condition `x > 1` may never become false due to the operation `x = 2*x`, which doubles the value of `x` if `x` is positive. When `x` is an initial positive integer greater than 1, `x` will grow indefinitely without reaching the terminating condition.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The value of `x` is doubling in each iteration when `x > 1`. If `x` starts off as a positive number greater than 1, it will keep increasing and never reach a value less than or equal to 1, hence the loop does not terminate.
