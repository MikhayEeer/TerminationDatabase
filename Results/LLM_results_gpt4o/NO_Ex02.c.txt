=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program contains a non-terminating loop when `i` is initially set to 5, as the condition `i != 5` prevents the loop variable `i` from decreasing, causing an infinite loop.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program is non-terminating when `i` is initialized to 5 because the condition in the while loop does not cause `i` to change and the loop continues indefinitely.
