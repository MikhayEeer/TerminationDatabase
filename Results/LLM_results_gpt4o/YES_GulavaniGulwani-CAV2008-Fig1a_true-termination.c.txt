[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
y - x

This program is terminating because each iteration of the loop either increments `x` or `z`, resulting in `x` getting closer to `y`. As `x` is incremented when `z > x` and `z` is incremented otherwise, this guarantees that `x < y` eventually becomes false, terminating the loop. The difference `y - x` serves as a linear ranking function that strictly decreases with each iteration.
