This indicates that the function `cstrlen` will terminate as it iterates over the characters of the string until it encounters the null terminator '\0'. In this particular code, the input string `nondetString1` is allocated with a size determined by the nondeterministic value `length1`, and its last element is set to '\0'. The loop in `cstrlen` decreases the distance to the end of the string with each iteration, ensuring that it will eventually terminate.

cstrlen function iterates over the characters in a string until it encounters a null terminator ('\0'). The string `nondetString1` is guaranteed to have a null terminator because `nondetString1[length1-1] = '\0';` is explicitly assigning one at the end. Therefore, the function will iterate at most `length1` times, which guarantees termination. This can be captured with the ranking function decreasing linearly with the position of the null character, e.g., `length1` iterations.
