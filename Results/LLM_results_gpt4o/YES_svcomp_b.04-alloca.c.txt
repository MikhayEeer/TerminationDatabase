=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTION]
*x_ref - *y_ref

This program eventually terminates because the difference (*x_ref - *y_ref) decreases in every iteration of the loop, making it a linear ranking function and ensuring that the loop cannot execute indefinitely. The loop exits when *x_ref is no longer greater than *y_ref.
