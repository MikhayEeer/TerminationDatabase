1st phase: j from length-1 to 0
2nd phase: arr[j] from positive to 0

The program is terminating. In the first phase, the outer loop variable `j` iterates from `0` to `length-1`, ensuring that each element in the array `arr` is processed. In the second phase, the inner loop decrements the value of `arr[j]` from a positive value to `0`, which guarantees termination for each element at index `j`. The nested ranking function composed of these decreasing measures proves termination.

multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * length^1 + 0.0 * 1  
1.0 * sum(arr[j]) + 0.0 * 1

Explanation:  
The program consists of two main loops. The first loop initializes an array of a certain length with non-negative integers. The second loop iterates through the array and decrements each non-zero element to zero. The process is guaranteed to terminate as each element of the array is decreased to zero, and the number of elements is finite (given by `length`). Therefore, the ranking function can be expressed in two phases: 

- The first phase represents the iteration over the `length` of the array.
- The second phase represents the sum of elements in the array, which decreases over time until all elements are zero.
