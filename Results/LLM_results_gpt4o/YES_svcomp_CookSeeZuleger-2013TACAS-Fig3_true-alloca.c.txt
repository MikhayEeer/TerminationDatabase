[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 *  x^1  

Explanation: 

- The program uses two pointers, `x` and `y`, which point to integers allocated on the stack.
- In each iteration of the loop, either `*x` is decreased by 1, or `*x` is assigned a non-deterministic value and `*y` is decreased by 1.
- The loop continues as long as `*x > 0` and `*y > 0`.
- For termination, we consider the ranking function `1.0 * x^1` which maps values of `*x` to non-negative integers.
- When choosing the first branch (`*x = *x - 1`), the ranking function strictly decreases by 1.
- In the other branch, even if `*x` is assigned a new value, `*y` decreases by 1.
- This guarantees that the loop cannot execute indefinitely, hence proving termination.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program can enter a state where *x is reset to a non-deterministic value while *y is decremented. If the non-deterministic value for *x always provides a positive number, and eventually the same or another non-deterministic choice does not decrement *x fast enough or at all, the loop may never terminate. Thus, non-termination is possible.
