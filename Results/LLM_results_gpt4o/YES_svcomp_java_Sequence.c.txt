The two loops are independent and have constant bounds, therefore both are trivially terminating. 

Ranking function for the first loop:  
100 - i (decreases from 100 to 0)

Ranking function for the second loop:  
(21 - j) / 3 (decreases from 5 steps 5 to 0)

Overall the program is terminating as both loops terminate.
