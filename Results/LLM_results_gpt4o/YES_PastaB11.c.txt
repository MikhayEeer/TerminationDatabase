[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
piecewise
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
In regions where \(x > y\): 
x + y

In regions where \(x \leq y \):
x + y

The program's termination can be proved using a ranking function based on the linear combination of \(x\) and \(y\). The sum \(x + y\) strictly decreases in each iteration of the loop as it decrements either \(x\) or \(y\), depending on their values, and thus, serves as a valid piecewise ranking function showing termination.

[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * (x + y)^1
