=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program can enter an infinite loop if initially x equals y and both are positive, because the outer while loop condition (x == y) && (x > 0) will still be true after the inner loop completes since both x and y are decremented at the same rate, thereby maintaining x == y.
