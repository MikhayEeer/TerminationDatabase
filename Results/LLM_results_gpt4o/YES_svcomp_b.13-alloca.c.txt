[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * (x - z) + 1.0 * (y - z)

Explanation: The program reduces either `x` or `y` towards `z` in each iteration of the loop. The loop condition checks if either `x > z` or `y > z`. Thus, the value of either `x - z` or `y - z` decreases with every iteration. The linear combination of `x - z` and `y - z` serves as the ranking function that shows strictly decreasing values, which proves termination.

[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 *  x_ref^1
1.0 *  y_ref^1

The program terminates because the values of `*x_ref` and `*y_ref` are both being decremented in each iteration of the loop when they are greater than `*z_ref`. This ensures that both `*x_ref` and `*y_ref` will eventually become less than or equal to `*z_ref`, causing the loop condition (`(*x_ref > *z_ref) || (*y_ref > *z_ref)`) to become false, thereby terminating the loop.
