[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
The while loop in the `cstrreplace` function decreases the distance to  the null-terminating character of the string `s` in each iteration by advancing the pointer `p`. Since `s` is guaranteed to be null-terminated (the null character is placed at the end of the string in `main`), the pointer `p` will eventually reach this null character, causing the loop to terminate. The loop is bounded by the length of the string `s`, which is finite and determined by `length1`, which is always at least 1.

[RANKING FUNCTION]  
strlen(p)  

Explanation:  
The program will terminate because the `cstrreplace` function iterates over a null-terminated string until it reaches the end (i.e., character '\0'). The linear ranking function is the length of the remaining part of the string from the current pointer `p`, which decreases by one with every iteration of the `while` loop until it reaches zero. Hence the program terminates.
