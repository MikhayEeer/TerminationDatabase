=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
x^1 (when x > 0)  
y^1 (when x <= 0 and y > 0)  

This program will terminate because the ranking function decreases strictly in each phase:  
1. When `x > 0`, the variable `x` decreases because whenever the inner `if` condition is true, `x` is decremented by 1 while `y` can be any value, keeping the progress towards termination.  
2. When `x <= 0`, the variable `y` must still be greater than 0 to continue the loop. However, the program will decrease the value of `y`, resulting in its decrease towards 0, eventually terminating the loop.  
Thus, the phases ensure that the program termination is achieved.
