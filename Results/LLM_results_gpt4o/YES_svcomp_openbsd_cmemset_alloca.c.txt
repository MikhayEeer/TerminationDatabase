[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * n^1

The program is terminating because the `cmemset` function contains a loop that iterates while `n` is not zero, decrementing `n` in each iteration. Because `n` starts as a non-negative value due to the conditional check in `main`, and is decremented in each iteration, the linear ranking function `1.0 * n^1` shows that the loop strictly decreases towards termination when `n` reaches zero. The main function itself does not contain any loops that may lead to non-termination.
