[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
min(p, q)  

The program is terminating because the value of `min(p, q)` is guaranteed to decrease in each iteration of the loop. The loop continues while both `p` and `q` are positive and not equal, and in each step, either `p` or `q` is decremented, thus reducing the minimum of the two until one becomes zero or they become equal, at which point the loop terminates.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
piecewise  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
min(p, q)  

The program terminates because the value of `min(p, q)` strictly decreases with each iteration of the loop as one of the values `p` or `q` is decreased each time, while the other is reset but remains non-negative. Once either `p` or `q` reaches zero, the loop exits.
