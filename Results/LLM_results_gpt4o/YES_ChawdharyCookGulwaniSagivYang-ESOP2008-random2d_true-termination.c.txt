[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
N - i  

The program is terminating because the loop iterates a fixed number of times, exactly `N` times. Each iteration of the loop increments `i` by 1, and once `i` reaches `N`, the loop condition `i < N` becomes false, causing the loop to terminate. Thus, the linear ranking function `N - i` monotonically decreases with each loop iteration until it reaches zero, proving termination.
