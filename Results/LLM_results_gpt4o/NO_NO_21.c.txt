NONTERM
[REASON]
The loop does not change the value of `i` effectively, as `i` is incremented by 1 and then immediately decremented by 1 in each iteration, leading to an infinite loop.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The loop condition `i < 100` is always true due to the operations `i = i+1; i = i-1;` inside the loop which reset `i` back to its original value. Hence, the loop will never terminate.
