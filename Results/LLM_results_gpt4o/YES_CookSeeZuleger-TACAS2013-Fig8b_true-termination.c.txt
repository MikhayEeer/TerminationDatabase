=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
piecewise  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1. (for x > M): 0  
2. (for x <= M): M - x  

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
piecewise  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1. x - M if x > M  
2. M - x if x < M  

The program is terminating. The piecewise ranking functions show decrease towards zero, leading to the loop's termination as x approaches M.
