=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The function `transmit1` contains a function call to `error()` inside an infinite loop, which will call `__VERIFIER_error()` and cause the program to enter an undefined state without termination. Additionally, the infinite loop in the `eval` function continuously checks for and executes runnable threads without a clear halting condition within those threads, leading to potential nontermination.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The `transmit1` function includes an infinite loop due to the recursive call to `error()` within the `T1_WAIT` label path, making the program non-terminating.
