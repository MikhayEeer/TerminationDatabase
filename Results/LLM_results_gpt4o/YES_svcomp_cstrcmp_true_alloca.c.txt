[RANKING FUNCTION]  
The function `cstrcmp` iterates over the characters in the strings `s1` and `s2` until the end of either string or until a differing character is found. The loop condition is based on the contents of the strings, which are guaranteed to terminate when a null character is encountered, as null terminators are explicitly set. This provides a linear progression towards reduction that guarantees termination. Hence, considering `n` as the minimum length between the two strings, the ranking function is:  
`n - number of iterations`

length1 + length2  

Explanation:  
The main function allocates two non-deterministic strings of lengths `length1` and `length2`, each with a null terminator at the end. The function `cstrcmp` then compares these two strings character by character until it encounters a difference or reaches the end of either string (indicated by the null terminator `\0`). The loop within `cstrcmp` iterates at most `length1 - 1` or `length2 - 1` times, whichever is smaller. Thus, the execution of this program is bounded and terminates after a finite number of steps.
