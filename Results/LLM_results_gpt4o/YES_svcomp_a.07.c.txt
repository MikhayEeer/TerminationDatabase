[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
x - max(y, z)  

This program will terminate because the difference between `x` and the maximum of `y` and `z` is strictly decreasing with each iteration of the loop. Therefore, the program is guaranteed to eventually reach a state where the loop condition `(x > y) && (x > z)` no longer holds.
