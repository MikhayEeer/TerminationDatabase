multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
Phase 1: 1.0 * da  
Phase 2: 2.0 * da + 0.0 * db + -2.0

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
Phase 1: 1.0 * da^1 + 1.0  
Phase 2: 1.0 * db^1 + 1.0  

Explanation:  
The program uses a non-deterministic choice to decrease `da` and update `db` to eventually terminate the while loop when `da < r`. The multi-phase ranking function demonstrates decreased values in `da` and `db` in each phase of the loop, ensuring termination.
