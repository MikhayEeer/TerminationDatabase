[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * -x + 1.0 *  z


=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
Phase 1: -x + z (decreases in each iteration as x grows exponentially beyond the bounds of z)  
Phase 2: x (eventually ensures termination as it moves away from non-negative bounds)
