[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
x_ref - y_ref

The program is terminating because the loop decrement happens through the condition `*x_ref > *y_ref`, with `*y_ref` being incremented by 1 in each iteration. Eventually, `*y_ref` will become equal to `*x_ref`, causing the loop to terminate. The linear ranking function `x_ref - y_ref` strictly decreases for each iteration and will be zero when the loop terminates.

[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
x - y

The program is terminating because in each iteration of the loop, the value of `*y_ref` is incremented, which effectively decreases the difference `*x_ref - *y_ref`. Since `*x_ref` is constant and integers are bounded in real systems, eventually `*y_ref` will reach the value of `*x_ref`, causing the loop to terminate. The difference `x - y` serves as a simple linear ranking function that decreases with each iteration.
