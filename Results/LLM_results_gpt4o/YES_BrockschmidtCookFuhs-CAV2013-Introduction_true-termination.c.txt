[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
0.5 * x - 0.5 * y - 0.25

Explanation:
The linear ranking function 0.5 * x - 0.5 * y - 0.25 shows that in each iteration of the loop, the value of the function decreases. The variable x is decremented by y, and y is incremented by 1 in each iteration, causing the expression to continually decrease until the loop exits. This guarantees termination of the program.
