[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
Outer loop: *n - *i
Inner loop: *i + 1 - *j

Explanation: The outer loop (`while (*i < *n)`) has a ranking function of *n - *i which decreases as *i increments toward *n. The inner loop (`while (*j <= *i)`) will terminate as *j increments until it exceeds *i. Thus, both loops will eventually terminate, proving the overall termination of the program.
