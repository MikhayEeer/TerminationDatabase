=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 *  x^1 + 0.0 *  y^1

Explanation: The program will terminate because the value of `x` is strictly decreasing in each iteration of the loop and will eventually become less than or equal to `y`. The linear ranking function `x` decreases by 1 in each iteration, and since it starts with a value greater than `y`, it will eventually reach `y`.
