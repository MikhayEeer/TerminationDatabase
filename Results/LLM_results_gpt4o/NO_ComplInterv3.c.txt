1.0 * -(i - 6)^1 for i > 5  
1.0 * (i + 6)^1 for i < -5  
linear constant for -5 ≤ i ≤ 5  

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program does not terminate because when `i > 5`, the value of `i` is incremented by 1, causing it to loop indefinitely since it will always remain greater than 5.
