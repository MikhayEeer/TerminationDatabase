The program terminates because it uses a multi-phase approach to ensure the variables decrease in ordered phases as the program progresses. The multi-phase ranking is composed of two functions, one for each significant phase, ensuring first `z` decreases and once `y` becomes negative, it switches phase to decrease `y` until it terminates the loop.
