1.0 * (|x - y| - 2)^1 + 0.0 * 1 + 0.0 * 1

The while loop in the program will terminate because the absolute difference between `x` and `y`, denoted as `|x - y|`, will decrease each time the loop is executed. Initially, `|x - y|` must be greater than 2 to enter the loop, but with each iteration, either `x` or `y` is incremented, steering `|x - y|` towards 2, at which point the loop condition `x - y > 2 || y - x > 2` would fail, and the loop will terminate. The ranking function `|x - y| - 2` is a strictly decreasing non-negative integer at each step inside the loop, ensuring termination.

[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
piecewise  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
Partition 1: When x < y, use ranking function:  
1.0 * (y - x)^1 + 0.0 * 1  

Partition 2: When x >= y, use ranking function:  
1.0 * (x - y)^1 + 0.0 * 1  

This partitioning demonstrates that the program terminates as both piecewise ranking functions decrease until the loop exits when the condition becomes false.
