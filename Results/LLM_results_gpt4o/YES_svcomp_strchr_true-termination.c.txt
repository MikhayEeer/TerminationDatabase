The program terminates because `cstrchr` scans a null-terminated string and stops when it reaches either the desired character or the end of the string. Since the string is guaranteed to be null-terminated (as constructed in `__VERIFIER_nondet_String`), the loop will always reach the null character, causing termination. The ranking function decreases deterministically as it approaches the end of the string.
