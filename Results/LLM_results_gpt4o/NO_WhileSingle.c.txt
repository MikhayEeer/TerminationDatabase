=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program enters an infinite loop if `i` is initialized to 3, since the condition `i < 10` will always be true and `i` is never incremented inside the loop when `i == 3`.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The loop does not terminate when `i` starts at a value less than 10 and equal to 3, as `i` remains unchanged in this case, causing an infinite loop.
