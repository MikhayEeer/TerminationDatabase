=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * |s1|^1
1.0 * |s2|^1

This program terminates because the loops involved decrement through the strings towards their null terminators without repeating indefinitely. Each iteration of the outer loop examines one character of `s1`, ensuring linear progress towards the string's end, making the ranking functions defined over the lengths of the strings involved.
