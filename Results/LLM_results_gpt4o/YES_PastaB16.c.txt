TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
lexicographic
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * x^1 + 0.0 * y^0
0.0 * x^0 + 1.0 * y^1

Explanation: The program has a nested loop structure where the outer loop's variable `x` strictly decreases with each iteration, and the inner loop strictly decreases variable `y` until it reaches zero. Once `y` is zero, the outer loop decreases `x`, ensuring `x` and `y` are both decreased in a lexicographic manner which guarantees termination.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
nested
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 *  x^1 + 0.0 * 1  (outer loop)
1.0 *  y^1 + 0.0 * 1  (inner loop) 

The nested loops have separate linear ranking functions for each. The inner loop decreases `y` non-negatively for each iteration, leading to its termination. Once `y` reaches zero, the inner loop exits, allowing `x` to decrement, ultimately leading the outer loop to terminate as `x` also becomes non-positive.
