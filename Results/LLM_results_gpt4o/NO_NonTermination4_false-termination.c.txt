=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The variables `x` and `y` grow exponentially, maintaining the condition `x >= 0` forever, causing the loop to run indefinitely.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The values of `x` and `y` keep doubling and tripling respectively, so `x` never becomes negative, causing the loop to execute indefinitely.
