=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * i^1 + 0.0 * 1  
1.0 * (i - j)^1 + 0.0 * 1  

The program terminates because `i` is decreasing and bounded below by 0, while `j` resets to 0 at the start of the inner loop and increments up to `i-1`, making the inner loop terminate as well. Together, these conditions ensure that the outer loop also terminates.
