First level: b decreases for each two steps in the cycle if initially b >= 0.
Second level: a decreases when b = -1 due to the decrement in b, leading to eventual exit since a must become negative when b continuously reduces 'a' by at least 1 in each cycle.

[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
First Phase:  
\( a + 1 \) when \( b \leq 0 \)  
Second Phase:  
\( b^2 + 1 \) when \( b > 0 \)  

Explanation: The program has two phases. In the first phase, if \( b \leq 0 \), the function \( a + 1 \) strictly decreases every iteration since \( b \) will remain non-positive, and \( a \) will decrease by at least 1. In the second phase, if \( b > 0 \), then \( b \) is reassigned to a negative number or decremented further; hence \( b^2 + 1 \) decreases. The loop terminates when \( a < 0 \).
