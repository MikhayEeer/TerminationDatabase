Phase 1: If `n > 0`, use the function `f(m, n) = n`.  
Phase 2: If `n < 0`, use the function `f(m, n) = -n`.  

Explanation:  
The recursive function `addition(int m, int n)` modifies the second parameter `n` either by subtracting 1 (if `n > 0`) or adding 1 (if `n < 0`) in each recursive call, bringing `n` closer to zero. For positive `n`, the ranking function `f(m, n) = n` decreases with each recursive call until it reaches 0, at which point the recursion terminates. Similarly, for negative `n`, the ranking function `f(m, n) = -n` decreases towards zero. The piecewise nature of the ranking function addresses both positive and negative values of `n`, assuring termination.

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
For the function `addition`:
- When `n > 0`: the ranking function is `n`.
- When `n < 0`: the ranking function is `-n`. 

For the `main` function:
- Since the function `addition` terminates, and the main function only deals with non-negative values for `m` and `n`, it terminates as well.
