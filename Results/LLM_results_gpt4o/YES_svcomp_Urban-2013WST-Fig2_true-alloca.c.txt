[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
lexicographic
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1st component: 11 - *x1
2nd component: *x2 - 1

The program has a lexicographic ranking function. The first component (11 - *x1) decreases in every outer loop iteration and stays non-negative until the loop terminates. The second component (*x2 - 1) decreases and remains non-negative for each iteration of the inner loop until it terminates, ensuring progress towards the exit condition of the outer loop.
