=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program is non-terminating for the initial values x = -1 and y = 0. For these values, the guard of the loop (x < y) is false due to -1 being less than 0, thus the loop never executes and the program will not terminate.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program is non-terminating for the values x = -1 and y = 0, as it leads to a loop where x remains constant and y stays at 0, causing the condition (x < y) to be false and the loop to iterate indefinitely.
