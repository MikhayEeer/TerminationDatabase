[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
x_ref + y_ref

The program is terminating because in each iteration of the loop, either *x_ref or *y_ref is decremented by 1 based on the comparison between *x_ref and *y_ref. Thus, the sum *x_ref + *y_ref is strictly decreased in each iteration, serving as a linear ranking function that eventually reaches zero or a negative value, causing the loop to terminate.
