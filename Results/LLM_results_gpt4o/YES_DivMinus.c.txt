=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * (x - y)^1 + 0.0 * 1

This linear ranking function shows that the program is terminating as the value \( x - y \) decreases by \( y \) in each iteration of the loop, and since \( y \) is positive, the loop must eventually terminate.
