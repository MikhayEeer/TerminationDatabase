TERMINATE

N - i

Explanation:
The given program is terminating because of the following reason: 
The outer loop iterates with the control variable 'i' from 0 to N-1, which guarantees termination after at most N iterations (where N is the variable 'array_size' passed to `test_fun()`).

The inner while-loop `while (a[i] > 0)` decreases `a[i]` in every iteration because of `a[i]--`, ensuring that `a[i]` will eventually become non-positive. Therefore, each invocation of the while-loop will terminate.

The ranking function `N - i` demonstrates that the value decreases monotonically and will reach 0, ensuring termination of the program.
