The program is a distributed algorithm that uses multiple nodes and a loop that iterates a fixed number (6) of times. The key reasoning behind termination is that the loop-controlled variable `i2` starts at 0 and is incremented until it reaches 6. Once `i2` equals 6, the loop terminates. This can be modeled using multi-phase ranking functions: the first function `i2^1` starts from 0 and increases with each iteration, while the second function decreases from `6 - i2`. This pair shows that the loop will terminate when `i2` reaches 6.
