=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * x^1

Explanation: The program's termination depends on the while loop, `while(x >= 0)`, where `x` is decreased by `k` in each iteration. Since `k` is a positive integer between 0 and 1048 (exclusive) and `x` starts as a non-negative integer, the loop will eventually terminate when `x` becomes negative. Thus, this can be proved with a linear ranking function `1.0 * x^1`, showing that `x` is decreasing in every iteration and the loop will exit.
