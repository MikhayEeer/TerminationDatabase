[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
Phase 1: Multi-phase loop (L1)   
1.0 * (*k - *z)^1 already bounded by the condition *z >= *k

Phase 2: Multi-phase loop (L2)  
1.0 * *z^1

Explanation:  
The program terminates because the loops have certain conditions that are met after a finite number of iterations. 

- In L1, the loop `while (*z < *k)` will eventually terminate since *z is being doubled and will surpass or become equal to *k.  
- In phase 2 (loop L2), variable *z decreases consistently every time `P1` block is executed, providing a sub-ranking function that will terminate the loop when *z becomes non-positive.  

With these observations, the program can be shown to be terminating with the multi-phase ranking functions provided.
