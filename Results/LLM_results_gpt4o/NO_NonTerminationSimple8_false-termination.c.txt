[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program allows for an infinite loop due to nondeterministic increments of `x`, which can keep increasing indefinitely, ensuring the continuation of the loop while `x >= 0`.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program potentially enters into an infinite loop because the value of `x` is continuously incremented by a positive number from 1 to 4 within the loop when `x >= 0`, causing it never to become less than 0. The loop may only exit if the break condition is randomly chosen from `__VERIFIER_nondet_int()`, which lacks a guarantee of occurrence.
