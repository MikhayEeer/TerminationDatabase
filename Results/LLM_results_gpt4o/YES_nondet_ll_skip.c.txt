[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1. At entry of `skip`: use the number of elements in the list `head` as a ranking function.  
2. During `skip` execution: if `head->value == m`, the function processes the next node or exits. The number of nodes with `value == m` decrements on each iteration, ensuring termination.
