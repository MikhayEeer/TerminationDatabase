=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The mutual recursion between functions `rec1` and `rec2` can lead to non-termination. Specifically, `rec2` can call `rec1` repeatedly without decreasing calls due to the nested nature of the recursive calls combined with potential non-decreasing behavior in the transformation of values.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The mutually recursive calls between `rec1` and `rec2` can create an infinite descent without reaching the base case, as they can repeatedly decrease their arguments in a manner that does not guarantee reaching zero.
