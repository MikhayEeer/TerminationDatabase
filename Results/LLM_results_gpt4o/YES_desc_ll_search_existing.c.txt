n - m

Explanation: The program initializes a linked list of size `n` and searches for a node with the value `m`. The search function iteratively moves through the list from the head until it finds the node with the value `m`. Since both `n` and `m` are constrained by conditions (n > 1, 1 <= m < n) and the list is initialized with values in ascending order starting from 0, the search will inevitably reach the node with value `m`, ensuring termination. The ranking function `n - m` decreases by 1 for each iteration, proving termination.

[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
piecewise
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
length of the list until a node with value `m` is reached

Explanation:
The `search` function traverses a linked list starting from `head` and terminates as soon as it finds a node with the value `m`. Since `m` is ensured to be within the bounds of the list (0 â‰¤ m < n), the search process will eventually reach the node with the value `m` or the end of the list. Hence, the program will terminate. The ranking function can be understood as decreasing the distance from the current node to the target node with value `m`.
