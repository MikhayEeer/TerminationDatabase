x based on its relation to 100:
- If x > 100, directly returns x - 10, hence terminates.
- For x <= 100, the function recursively calls itself with increased argument (x+11), which eventually becomes greater than 100, leading to termination.

The `f91` function implements the McCarthy 91 function, which is known to always terminate for integer inputs. The recursion ensures that eventually any input x will either return a value greater than 90 or recurse out because x becomes progressively larger. Thus, the nested ranking function follows from the nature of recursion converging to terminating conditions.

1. The primary ranking function involves a comparison of `x` against 100 within the `f91` function.
   If `x > 100`, the function directly returns `x - 10`, terminating the recursion.
2. The secondary ranking function is involved when `x <= 100`, where `f91` calls itself twice with `x + 11`.
   Within two nested calls, the value of `x` will reach or exceed 101, ensuring that eventual reductions are made to `x` leading to termination.
