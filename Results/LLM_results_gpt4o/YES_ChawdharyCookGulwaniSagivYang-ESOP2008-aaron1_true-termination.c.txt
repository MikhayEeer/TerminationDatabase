[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1st phase: (an - i)   
2nd phase: (bn - j)   

The program is terminating. The loop will continue until both `i` exceeds `an` and `j` exceeds `bn`. There are two phases here:  
1. The first phase focuses on `i` incrementing to surpass `an`.  
2. The second phase focuses on `j` incrementing to surpass `bn`.

As the loop progresses, one of these ranking functions decreases with each iteration until the loop condition is no longer met. Hence, the program will eventually terminate.
