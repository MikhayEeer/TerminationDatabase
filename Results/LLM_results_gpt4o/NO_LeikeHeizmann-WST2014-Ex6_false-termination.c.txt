=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The variables `a` and `b` are both multiplied by constant factors greater than 1 in each iteration, leading to an unbounded increase. The condition `a >= 1 && b >= 1` will always hold if `a` and `b` are initially positive, creating an infinite loop.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The values of `a` and `b` are both doubled and tripled respectively in each loop iteration, meaning they will always remain non-negative for any non-negative initial values, thus the loop condition `a >= 1 && b >= 1` can be satisfied indefinitely.
