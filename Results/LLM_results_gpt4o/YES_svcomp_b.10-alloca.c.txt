[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 *  x_ref^1 + 1.0 *  y_ref^1

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
\( f(x, y) = x + y \)

Explanation:  
The loop will decrement either `*x_ref` or `*y_ref` in each iteration such that `*x_ref + *y_ref` is reduced by 1 until the condition `*x_ref + *y_ref > 0` is no longer satisfied, proving that the program terminates.
