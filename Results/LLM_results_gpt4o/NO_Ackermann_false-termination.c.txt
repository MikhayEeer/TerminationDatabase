=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program contains a call to the Ackermann function, which is known for its non-terminating behavior when `x >= 0` and `y < 0`. In such cases, the program enters an infinite recursion without hitting a base case leading to termination.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program does not terminate for inputs where x >= 0 and y < 0 due to the nature of the Ackermann function and the recursive calls with non-decreasing arguments.
