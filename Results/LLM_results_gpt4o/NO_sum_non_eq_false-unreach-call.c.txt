=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program allows for non-terminating behavior if the value of `a` is negative, causing the recursive calls in `sum` to continue indefinitely, as the base case `n == 0` is never reached.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program is non-terminating because the function `sum` will not terminate when `n` is negative, as the base case `n == 0` is never reached by decrementing `n`.
