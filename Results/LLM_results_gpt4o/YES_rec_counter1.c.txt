[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
For the outer recursive function `rec(a)`, a linear ranking function is sufficient:
a (the depth of recursion function call decreases as the recursion goes deeper) 

For the inner `while` loop within the `rec` function which operates on `rescopy`:
rescopy (the value decreases until it reaches zero)  

The combination of the recursion decreasing and the termination of the `while` loop within each recursion proves that the program is terminating.
