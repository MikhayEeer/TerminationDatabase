=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The loops in `m_run` and `s_run` functions depend on the state of various request and response flags (e.g., `c_write_req_ev`, `c_empty_rsp`) which don't have a guarantee of transition to a state that would cause termination. Additionally, the `eval` function repeatedly calls `m_run` and `s_run` functions in a loop without changing the conditions required for these functions to terminate, leading to potential infinite execution.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The `while` loops in `m_run` and `s_run` functions depend on concurrency-driven events that can indefinitely delay the loops' exit conditions. The nondeterministic nature of the events (`c_m_lock`, `c_empty_req`, `c_empty_rsp`) means that the loops can potentially run infinitely without necessarily reaching a termination state.
