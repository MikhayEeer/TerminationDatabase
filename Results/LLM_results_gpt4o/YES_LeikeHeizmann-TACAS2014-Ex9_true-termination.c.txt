1. In the case where `q < p`:  
   Ranking function: q (since it decreases by 1 in each iteration of the loop and is bounded below by 0)  

2. In the case where `p < q`:  
   Ranking function: p (since it decreases by 1 in each iteration of the loop and is bounded below by 0)  

In both cases, the respective ranking function strictly decreases and is bounded below by 0, ensuring that the loop will terminate.

Explanation: The program is structured such that in each iteration of the loop, either `q` or `p` is decreased by 1 if they are not equal. The termination of this program is ensured because the values of `q` and `p` are strictly decreasing until they are equal, at which point the loop terminates. If `q` and `p` are equal before entering the loop, the loop will not execute. Thus, the program will always terminate, which can be shown using a piecewise ranking function considering the pair `(q, p)`.
