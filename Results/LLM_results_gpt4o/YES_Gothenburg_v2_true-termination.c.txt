[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
0.5 * x + 0.5 * y  

The program is terminating because both variables `x` and `y` decrease by `1` in every iteration of the loop, hence strictly reducing the value of the linear combination `0.5 * x + 0.5 * y`. This linear ranking function ensures that the while-loop can only execute a finite number of times.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The loop condition `x >= 0 || y >= 0` can be perpetually true as the updates `x = x + a - b - 1` and `y = y + b - a - 1` do not ensure progress towards termination, especially when `a == b + 1`. The changes in `x` and `y` effectively cancel out, which can result in neither `x` nor `y` decreasing sufficiently to exit the loop, given certain initial values.
