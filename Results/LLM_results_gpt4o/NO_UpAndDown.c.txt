if (up == 1) then (10 - i)  
if (up == 0) then (i)  

The program alternates between increasing and decreasing `i`, ensuring the while loop condition `0 <= i && i <= 10` will eventually be violated as `i` moves towards exit bounds. The ranking function is piecewise, depending on whether `up` is set to 1 or 0.

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
First Phase:
- Function: 11 - i for i >= 0 and i <= 10 and up = 1 (Strictly Decreases)
Second Phase:
- Function: i for i >= 0 and i <= 10 and up = 0 (Strictly Decreases)

The program transitions between increasing and decreasing the value of `i` within the bounds of 0 and 10. When `i` reaches the boundary (either 0 or 10), the direction of change reverses. The mechanism guarantees that the loop will eventually exit once `i` moves beyond these boundaries, ensuring termination.
