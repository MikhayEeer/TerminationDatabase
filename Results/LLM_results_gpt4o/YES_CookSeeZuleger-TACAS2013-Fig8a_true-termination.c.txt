=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
|x| (absolute value of x)  

The program is terminating because the value of `x` is strictly decreasing towards zero, no matter whether it is initially positive or negative. In each iteration of the loop, the magnitude of `x` gets reduced by 1, which ensures termination.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
abs(x)  

The program is terminating because the absolute value of `x` serves as a linear ranking function that decreases by 1 in each iteration of the loop, eventually reaching 0, at which point the loop terminates.
