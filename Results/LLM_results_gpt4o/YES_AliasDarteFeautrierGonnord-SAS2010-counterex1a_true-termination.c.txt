1.0 * n^1 + 1.0 * 1 + 1.0 * 1  

This program terminates. The key points include:
- In the first phase (outer loop), the ranking function `1.0 * -1 * x^1` ensures that `x` is non-negative initially and decreases whenever `b != 0`, which contributes to the eventual fulfilment of the loop exit condition.
- The second phase is trivially true since y will eventually go out of the bounds defined by `y >= 0 && 0 <= y && y <= n`, hence terminating the loop. 

The combination of conditions in the loop and the ranking functions lead to an eventual termination.
