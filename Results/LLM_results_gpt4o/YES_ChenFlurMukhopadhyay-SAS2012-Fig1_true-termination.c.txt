2nd Level:  
|y + z^1|  
   
Explanation:  
The ranking function is nested with two levels. On the 1st level, the ranking function `0.5 * x + 0.5 * |z|` shows the primary decreasing measure. As long as `x` is positive, the loop's control variable `x` eventually decreases, moving towards termination. At the 2nd level, changes in `y` and `z` are captured by `|y + z|`, controlling secondary behaviors. The program ensures that for each execution of the loop, the principal decreasing measure and secondary conditions eventually lead the variables towards program termination.
