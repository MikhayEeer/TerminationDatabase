=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The loop is non-terminating because for any initial value of `i` between 30 and 40, `i` oscillates downwards, resulting in a repeated cycling within the same range without leaving the range 30 to 40. Thus, the loop continues indefinitely for these values.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The loop contains contradictory conditional updates and overlapping ranges, which may cause the variable `i` to oscillate without reaching zero or exceeding 50, potentially resulting in an infinite loop.
