40 - x

The program terminates because in each iteration of the loop, the value of `x` is incremented by either 1 or 2. `x` starts at 0 and the loop continues while `x < 40`. This guarantees that the loop will eventually terminate since `x` will reach or exceed 40, causing the loop condition to become false. The linear ranking function `40 - x` decreases with every iteration, which proves termination.

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
40 - x  

The program is terminating because the value of `x` increases with every iteration of the loop, while `z` does not affect the termination condition. `x` starts at 0 and increases by 1 or 2 until it reaches 40, at which point the loop terminates. The ranking function `40 - x` is a linear function that demonstrates that with each iteration, the result decreases until it reaches 0, proving termination.
