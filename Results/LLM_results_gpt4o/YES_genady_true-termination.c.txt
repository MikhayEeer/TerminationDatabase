i - j

Explanation: 

The program uses a `for` loop that decrements the value of `i` and increments the value of `j` in each iteration. The execution of the loop depends on the condition `i - j >= 1`. Initially, `i` is set to 10000 and `j` is set to 1, so the difference `i - j` is initially 9999. In each iteration, the value of `i` decreases by 1 and `j` increases by 1, effectively making `i - j` decrease by 2. Since the difference `i - j` is positive initially and decreases by 2 in every iteration, it will eventually become less than 1, causing the loop to terminate. Hence, the program is terminating.

[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
i - j - 1  

The program is terminating. The ranking function `i - j - 1` strictly decreases by 1 in each iteration of the loop and is bounded below by 0. Initially, `i - j - 1` evaluates to 9998, and in each iteration `i` is decreased by 1 and `j` is increased by 1, thus making `i - j - 1` decrease by 2. Eventually, `i - j` becomes less than 1, and the loop terminates.
