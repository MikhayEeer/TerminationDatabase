[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
If (i > 0):  
   1.0 * i^1  
If (i < 0):  
   -1.0 * i^1  

Explanation:  
The program has a loop that terminates when `i` equals 0. Within the loop, if `i` is within the range (-5, 5), it is incremented towards 0 if negative and decremented towards 0 if positive. Thus, `i` will eventually reach 0 and the loop will terminate. The ranking functions demonstrate how the values decrease or increase monotonically towards 0, ensuring termination.
