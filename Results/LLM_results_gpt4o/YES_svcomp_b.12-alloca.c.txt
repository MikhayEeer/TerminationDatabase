=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
lexicographic
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
x_ref, y_ref

The program is terminating because the values of `*x_ref` and `*y_ref` are both being decremented in every iteration of the loop, and since they start as non-negative integers, they will eventually both reach zero, at which point the loop terminates. The lexicographic ranking function `x_ref, y_ref` implies that the primary measure (`*x_ref`) decreases until it hits zero, and whenever it's zero, the secondary measure (`*y_ref`) decreases until it also hits zero. This shows the loop terminates.
