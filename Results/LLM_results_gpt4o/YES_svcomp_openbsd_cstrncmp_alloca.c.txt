single-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
Length of the input strings `n`.  

[EXPLANATION]  
The `cstrncmp` function processes each character in the input strings `s1` and `s2` up to `n` times. In each iteration of the loop, either `n` is decremented, or the loop exits early if characters differ or a null character is encountered. Therefore, the program eventually terminates because the loop iterates a finite number of times, bounded by `n`.
