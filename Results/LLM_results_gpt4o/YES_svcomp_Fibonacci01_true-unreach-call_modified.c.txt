2. \( x^1 \text{ if } x \geq 1 \)  

The program is terminating as the function `fibonacci` will always reach a base case for any non-negative integer `x`.

1.0 * x for main function
n for fibonacci function with n>=0

This program is terminating. The termination can be shown using a piecewise ranking function. 
- For the `main()` function, the value of `x` decreases towards a base condition (`x < 1`) which exits the function.
- For the `fibonacci()` function, it gives a strictly decreasing multi-phase interpretation: `n` first, which eventually hits a base condition because the function is defined in terms of itself with decreasing values (`n-1`, `n-2`), leading to termination when `n < 1`.
