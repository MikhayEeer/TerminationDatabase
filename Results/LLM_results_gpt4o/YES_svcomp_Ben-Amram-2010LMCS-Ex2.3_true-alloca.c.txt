=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
Phase 1: 1.0 * (x > y) * (*z^1) + 0.0 * 1  
Phase 2: 1.0 * (x <= y) * (*y^1) + 0.0 * 1  

The given program can be proven terminating using a multi-phase ranking function. The phases are determined based on the comparison between *y and *x. For the first phase, when *y > *x, the ranking function is based on *z, which decrements in every loop iteration. Once the condition *y <= *x is met, the program transitions to the second phase, where the ranking function is based on *y, which also decrements. Both variables ensure that the program will terminate as they are bounded by their initial non-negative values and consistently decrease.
