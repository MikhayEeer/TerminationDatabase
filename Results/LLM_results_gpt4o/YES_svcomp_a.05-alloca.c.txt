*x_ref - *y_ref

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The loop in the `test_fun` function continues indefinitely if the initial value of `x` is strictly greater than `y` and `y` is non-negative, because `*x_ref` does not change within the loop, allowing `*y_ref` to increase towards but never reach `*x_ref`.
