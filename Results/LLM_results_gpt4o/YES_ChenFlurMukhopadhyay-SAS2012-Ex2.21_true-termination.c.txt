=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
non-linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1/2 * x^2 + 1/2 * y^2

Explanation: The program's loop terminates due to the non-linear nature of the updates to `x` and `y`. The quadratic expression `1/2 * x^2 + 1/2 * y^2` functions as a ranking function that decreases at each loop iteration because `x` eventually becomes non-positive, leading to the termination of the loop.
