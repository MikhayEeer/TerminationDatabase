Phase 1: 1.0 * m (for the first and second branches of the Ack function where m is strictly decreasing)  
Phase 2: 1.0 * n (for the third branch of the Ack function where n is strictly decreasing until the base case)  

Explanation:  
The Ackermann function is defined recursively, and each call decreases either \( m \) or \( n \) towards a base case when \( m \) is zero. The function terminates as long as both \( x \) and \( y \) are non-negative integers, which is ensured by the condition in `main()`. The recursive call structure ensures termination by strictly decreasing metrics.

[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
(x >= 0 && y >= 0) -> Ack(x, y) terminates due to each call reducing the lexicographic ordering (m, n) with strict decrease in m or eventual decrease in n after m reaches 0.
