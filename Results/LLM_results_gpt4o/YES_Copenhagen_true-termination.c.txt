[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
x + y + 2^1

This program is terminating because for each iteration of the loop: 
1. `x` and `y` both decrease at least by 1, thus the sum `x + y` decreases by at least 2.
2. Since `x` and `y` are non-negative and are strictly decreasing, the loop must eventually terminate when `x` or `y` becomes negative. 
Thus, a ranking function can be defined as `x + y + 2`, which consistently decreases with each iteration of the loop.
