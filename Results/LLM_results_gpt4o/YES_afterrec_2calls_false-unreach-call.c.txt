=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The mutual recursion between functions `f` and `f2` results in an endless loop without reaching the base condition where `n<3` and the recursive calls do not prevent it from reaching the `ERROR` label.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
Mutually recursive calls between f and f2 without a base condition to prevent indefinite alternation between the two functions.
