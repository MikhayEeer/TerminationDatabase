=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
piecewise  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1. x - z  
2. y - z  

The program is terminating because whenever the loop is entered, either `x` or `y` is greater than `z`. The loop body results in either `x` or `y` being decremented by 1, while `z` remains constant. Hence, the values of `x - z` and `y - z` are strictly decreasing and the loop will eventually terminate. The termination can be proven by using piecewise ranking functions as shown.
