[RESULT]  
TERMINATE

[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
nested

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
Primary function: x^1 when x == y  
Secondary function: y^1 within the inner loop while y > 0  

This program terminates because, when `x` and `y` are equal and greater than zero, the inner loop reduces both `x` and `y` until `y` becomes zero, decrementing both variables in lock-step. After it exits the inner loop, `x` is equal to `y` and both are zero, at which point the outer loop condition `x == y && x > 0` is false, and the program terminates.
