Explanation: The program terminates as each iteration of the outer `while` loop decreases `x` by 2. In the inner loop, `y` is decremented until it is less than `x`. Thus, the variables `x` and `y` are both bounded and decrease over time, indicating that this program concludes. The phases can be observed with `x` decreasing to terminate the outer loop and `y` within the inner loop.
