[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
2.0 * 1 + 1.0 * x^1 + 2.0 * 1  
0.1 * y^1 + 0.3 * 1 + 0.3 * 1  

This program's termination can be established using a multi-phase ranking function. Initially, the linear decrease in `x` when `y` causes a negative increase signifies termination towards negative values, as the combined operation will ultimately violate the `x >= 0` condition of the loop. The rapid decrease in `y` shrinks its overall contribution to `x` over iterations, ensuring that eventually, `x` will be decremented sufficiently to exit the loop.
