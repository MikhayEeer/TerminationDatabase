=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The condition `i <= j` in the while loop will always be satisfied once `j` is incremented to 2 while `i` is still 0, causing the loop to continue indefinitely.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The condition `i <= j` in the loop allows `i` to increase, but `j` can also increase, leading to a scenario where `i` catches up to `j`, and the loop condition remains true indefinitely.
