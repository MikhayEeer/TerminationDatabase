1.0 * (length2 - pt)  

Explanation:  
The program is terminating because in the while loop within the `subseq` function, the pointer `pt` is incremented in every iteration. Since the string `nondetString2` is guaranteed to terminate with a `'\0'`, `pt` will eventually reach the end of the string, causing the loop to terminate. The distance from `pt` to the end of `nondetString2` is a linear ranking function, ensuring the loop eventually ends.

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1. Length of the string `t` (`pt` dereferenced) decreases upon progression of `pt` in the outer loop  
2. Length of the substring of `s` (`ps` dereferenced) does not decrease without `pt` progressing, due to conditional increment of `ps`.  

Explanation: The function `subseq` processes two strings `s` and `t` by iterating over `t` and potentially incrementing `ps` when characters in both `s` and `t` match. The loop terminates when either string `t` is exhausted or all characters in `s` have been matched in sequence with characters from `t`. Furthermore, `pt` always progresses leading to eventual termination, ensuring `t` is completely processed.
