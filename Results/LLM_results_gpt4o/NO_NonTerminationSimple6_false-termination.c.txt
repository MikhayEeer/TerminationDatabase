=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program continuously increases `x` by a constant `c` (which is 5), ensuring that the condition `x >= 0` always holds. Hence, the loop does not terminate.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The variable `x` is incremented by a constant positive value `c` in each iteration when `x >= 0`, which means `x` will keep increasing perpetually, causing the loop to never terminate.
