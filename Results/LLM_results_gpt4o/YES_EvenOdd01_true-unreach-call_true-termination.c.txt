1.0 *  n^1 + 0.0 * 1  

The program is terminating. The recursive calls in the functions `isOdd` and `isEven` decrease the input `n` by 1 in each step until it reaches 0 or 1. When `n` is 0 or 1, the recursion stops, thus the program is terminating. The ranking function `1.0 * n` effectively reflects the decrease in `n` towards termination.

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1. n for n >= 0

This program always terminates because the values passed to `isOdd()` or `isEven()` functions are always decremented by 1, and since `n` is initially non-negative, they always reach 0 or 1, which are the base cases, and terminate. The recursive calls strictly decrease `n`, ensuring termination. The main loop doesnâ€™t involve any non-terminating cases due to the checks present for non-negative `n`.
