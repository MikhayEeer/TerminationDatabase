=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The loop condition `y < z` can be satisfied indefinitely if `y` and `z` are appropriately set by the nondeterministic values. Moreover, the `flag` is set to `0` only if both conditions fail, which can be avoided by choosing suitable values for `x` and `y`. Consequently, there exist paths where the loop condition remains true, and `flag` remains positive, causing non-termination.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` can be chosen such that the loop does not terminate. Specifically, if `y < z` and `y > 0` and `x` is chosen such that `x = 2`, then within the loop, `y` will be updated to `x * y`, leading to an exponential increase in `y`. Because `y < z` is a condition for the loop, and `z` can be a large positive value, the growth of `y` will never satisfy the termination condition, thus resulting in a non-terminating loop.
