=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The variable `x` can oscillate around `n` based on the value of `t` without reaching termination. Since `x` can be incremented and decremented, if `b` is managed in such a way that the loop condition `x <= n` remains true indefinitely by appropriate selections of `t`, the program can run infinitely.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
piecewise
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
For b >= 1, use the ranking function: n - x
For b < 1, no ranking function needed as the `while` loop condition will immediately fail since x <= n never becomes false because x is incremented by `-1` in the loop. The loop exits when the condition is already false at the beginning.
