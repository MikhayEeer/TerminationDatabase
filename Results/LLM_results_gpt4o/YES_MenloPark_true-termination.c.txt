[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
First phase: while z == 1 and y >= 100  
Ranking function: x  

Second phase: while z == -1 and y >= 99  
Ranking function: x  

The program has a multi-phase ranking function. In the first phase, when z == 1 and y >= 100, the function x decreases. In the second phase, when z == -1 and y >= 99, the function x decreases again. This satisfies the conditions for termination, concluding that the program will eventually terminate.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
Phase 1: x when y >= 100 and z = 1  
Phase 2: x when y >= 99 and z = 1  

This program uses a three-phase ranking function. The value of `x` is decreased in each iteration, and the conditions on `y` and `z` guide the transitions between the different phases, ultimately leading to termination when `x` becomes negative.
