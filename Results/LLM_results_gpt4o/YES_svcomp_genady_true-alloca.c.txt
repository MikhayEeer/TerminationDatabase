[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * i^1 + -1.0 * j^1 + 1.0 * 1

This ranking function shows that the expression \( *i - *j \) decreases with each iteration of the loop and will eventually reach a point where the loop condition `*i - *j >= 1` fails, thus proving the program terminates.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The loop condition `*i - *j >= 1` will always be true because *j is incremented at the same rate as *i is decremented, resulting in a constant difference.
