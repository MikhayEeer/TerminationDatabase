TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * x^1 + 0.5 * (y^2 + z^2) + 1.0 * 1

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
Phase 1:  
0.5 * x^2 + 0.5 * y^2 + 0.5 * z^2  
Phase 2:  
x + 0.5 * y + 1  

The program is terminating due to a decrease in the multi-phase ranking function as the loop progresses. The quadratic nature of `x`, `y`, and `z` ensures termination through suitable updates degrading the values until the loop condition `x >= 0` is violated.
