=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program enters a state where variables `a` and `b` swap values and increment indefinitely while maintaining the condition `a >= 7`, thus forming an infinite loop.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program has a cycle where `a` becomes `b`, and `b` becomes `a + 1`. If `a` starts at a value of 7 or more, the values of `a` and `b` will keep swapping and incrementing, creating an infinite loop with no termination condition.
