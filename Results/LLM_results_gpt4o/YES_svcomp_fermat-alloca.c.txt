The program is terminating. It systematically increments `a`, `b`, and `c` in a nested manner, and exits when `c` exceeds `MAX`. Each nested loop controls its respective variable, resetting and incrementing the next as necessary, ensuring a bounded termination when `c` reaches `MAX`. The ranking functions show that the values decrease towards termination in respective phases.

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
Ranking functions can be defined based on the nested escalation and reset of the variables a, b, and c. A suitable ranking function is a lexicographic ordering comprising the tuple (*MAX - *c, *MAX - *b, *MAX - *a), where the decrement in values signifies progress towards termination. 

This program is essentially equivalent to three nested loops with conditions that progressively "reset" inner loops and increment outer loops until the outermost loop terminates. Thus, it will eventually terminate.
