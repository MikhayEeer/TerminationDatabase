=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The value of `*x` can oscillate based on the initial nondeterministic condition, leading to the possibility of positive increments if `*x` > 0 or negative decrements if `*x` < 0 for both `*y` and `*z`. Hence, the loop condition `*y < 100 && *z < 100` may never be violated, leading to potential infinite execution.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
There is no guarantee that the increments and decrements to `*x` outside the loop affect termination since they toggle between -1 and 9 based on initial condition. The loop can run indefinitely when *x results in an increase to `*y` and a decrease to `*z` in such a way that their conditions remain true, particularly when their increments and decrements balance each other out.
