=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The value of `x` can increase indefinitely if `y` is greater than or equal to 0, making the loop condition `x > 0` continuously true. Thus, the program may not terminate.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The variable `x` can increase indefinitely if `y` is positive, leading to non-termination as the condition `x > 0` may remain true.
