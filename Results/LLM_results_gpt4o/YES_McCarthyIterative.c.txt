x - 110  
-(c + x)  

Explanation:

The loop can be divided into two phases depending on the value of `x`:
1. When `x > 100`, `x` decreases by 10 and `c` decreases by 1. This phase will bring `x` quickly down to 100 or below.
2. When `x <= 100`, `x` increases by 11 and `c` increases by 1. In this phase, `x` will eventually increase to a point where it can hit or exceed 100 again.

The first ranking function `x - 110` captures the first phase where the goal is to reduce `x` to a value near 100, with the ranking function eventually reaching a non-positive value. The second ranking function `-(c + x)` captures the multi-phase nature, showing that as `c` decreases, it ensures termination since `c` effectively limits the number of steps by decreasing in the first phase where `x > 100`, hence ensuring termination of the overall loop.

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
Lexicographic([c, -x])  

Explanation:  
The program uses a lexicographic ranking function consisting of the tuple [c, -x]. The value of 'c' decreases in the first branch (where x > 100), ensuring progress towards termination, and 'x' eventually becomes greater than 100 in the second branch (where x <= 100), which will cause 'c' to decrease eventually due to the positive increment of 'x'. This guarantees progress towards program termination.
