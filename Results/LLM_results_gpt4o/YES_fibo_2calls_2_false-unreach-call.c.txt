Explanation:  
The main function calls `fibo1(x)` with a fixed value of `x = 2`. The computation for `fibo1(2)` entails calculating `fibo2(1) + fibo2(0)`. Since `fibo2(1)` and `fibo2(0)` are base cases, they return 1 and 0, respectively. Thus, `fibo1(2)` returns 1. This program terminates after a finite number of recursive calls due to the decreasing argument `n` in recursive calls until reaching the base case, and there are no infinite loops or uncontrolled recursion.
