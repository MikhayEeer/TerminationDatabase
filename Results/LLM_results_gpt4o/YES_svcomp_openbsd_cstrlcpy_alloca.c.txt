linear  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
Size of the source string (`length`) continuously reduces or remains non-increasing as it is copied character by character to the destination string (`nondetString1`). This guarantees termination because the source string will eventually be exhausted, given that both `n` and `length` are initially set to positive values and decremented or stopped when they reach 0.

[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  

[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * n + 0.0  

The program will terminate for all inputs as the function `cstrlcpy` is bounded by `n`, which decreases linearly as the characters are copied, and additional constraints ensure `n` is a positive integer, thus making the loop finish after at most `n` iterations.
