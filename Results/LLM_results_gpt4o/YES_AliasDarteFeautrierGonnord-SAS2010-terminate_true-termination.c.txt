=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 *  (101 -  i)^1  
1.0 *  (k -  j)^1  

The program terminates as it first uses the ranking function \(101 - i\) which decreases on each iteration until \(i > 100\), and then uses \(k - j\) which decreases on each iteration until \(j > k\). Thus, the two-phase (multi-phase) ranking function ensures termination.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * (100 - i)^1 + 0.0 * 1  
1.0 * (k - j)^1 + 0.0 * 1  

The program terminates because it has a multi-phase ranking function. The first phase decreases based on `(100 - i)` due to the condition `i <= 100`, and the second phase is based on `(k - j)` due to the condition `j <= k`, ensuring termination.
