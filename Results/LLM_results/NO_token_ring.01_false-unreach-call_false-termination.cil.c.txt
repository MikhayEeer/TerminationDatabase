=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
In the `eval` loop, `exists_runnable_thread()` remains true but both `__VERIFIER_nondet_int()` guards can non‐deterministically always be false, causing the loop to spin forever without ever scheduling a thread.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The two threads continually re‐activate each other (master↔transmit1 ping-pong), so exists_runnable_thread() remains true and the main simulation loop never terminates.
