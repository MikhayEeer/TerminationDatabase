[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 *  x_ref + 0.0 *  y_ref^1 
1.0 *  (-1 * y_ref) + 0.0 *  y_ref^0 

Explanation: The program terminates because for each iteration of the outer loop, the value of `x_ref` is decreased by 1, creating a finite descending sequence. The inner loop terminates because `y_ref` is exponentially increased until it surpasses `x_ref`, at which point the inner loop exits, allowing the outer loop to continue its finite descent. The lexicographic ranking function demonstrates the descent in both loops.
