[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1. Outer Loop: x
2. Inner Loop: x - y

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
x (Phase 1)  
x - y (Phase 2)  

The program terminates as the outer loop decrements `x` until it becomes negative, and the inner loop resets `y` to 1 and increments it until it reaches `x`. This combination of decreasing `x` and controlling `y` ensures termination.
