1.0 * R(curr)

where R(curr) is the number of list‐nodes reachable from curr (i.e. the number of successive “next” pointers until NULL).  
On each loop iteration curr moves to curr→next, so R(curr) decreases by exactly 1 and is bounded below by 0, proving termination.

[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * dist(curr, NULL)

where dist(curr, NULL) is the number of “next”‐steps from the pointer curr to the NULL terminator of the list. Each loop iteration does one step along the list, strictly decreasing this distance until it reaches 0 and the loop exits.
