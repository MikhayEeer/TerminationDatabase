TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * i + 1.0 * j

Explanation:
The loop continues as long as `i - j >= 1`. Initially `i` is 10000 and `j` is 1. In each iteration, `i` is decremented by 1 and `j` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the value of `i - j` decreases by 2 during every iteration of the loop. Since `i` starts from a large positive number and the decrement operation will ensure that `i - j` eventually becomes less than 1, the loop will terminate. The linear ranking function `i + j` captures this decrementing behavior.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
i - j + 1

The program will terminate because the loop decreases `i - j` by 2 in each iteration, starting from 9999, and the loop condition `i - j >= 1` eventually becomes false.
