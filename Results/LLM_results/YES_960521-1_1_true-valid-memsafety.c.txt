=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
6.0 * 1 + 1.0 * 30^1 + 6.0 * 1
0.333 *  n^1 + 0.333 * 1 + 0.333 * 1

The program is terminating. The main loop is bounded by the condition `n < 30`, which, combined with the increment of `n` in each iteration, ensures termination. The loop can be proven to terminate with a multi-phase ranking function.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
piecewise
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
In the main loop of `main`, the ranking function is `30 - n`. Each iteration of the loop increases `n` by 1 until `n < 30` becomes false, causing the loop to terminate.
