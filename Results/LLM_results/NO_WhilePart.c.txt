=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
If the initial value of i is ≥ 10, then in the loop body no update occurs and i stays ≥ 10, so the loop never terminates.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
If i ≥ 10 initially, the while‐loop guard i>5 remains true and the body does not modify i, so execution loops infinitely.
