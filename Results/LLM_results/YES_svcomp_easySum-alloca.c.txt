TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
bound - i

The program is terminating because the `for` loop within the `iterate` function has a clear termination condition. It iterates from `0` to `bound_ref - 1`, incrementing `i` by `1` each time. The loop terminates as soon as `i` is no longer less than `bound_ref`, which establishes a linear ranking function `bound - i`, demonstrating that the program will always terminate after a finite number of steps.
