=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The nondeterministic input can always choose x′≥2·old_x>2, so x remains >1 and the break never fires, yielding an infinite loop.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
There is an execution where at each iteration the nondeterministic x satisfies x ≥ 2·old_x, so the break is never taken and x remains >1 forever, yielding an infinite loop.
