Phase 1 (odd iterations): f₁(x,y,z) = x + z  
Phase 2 (even iterations): f₂(x,y,z) = x  

Explanation of decrease:
– On odd iterations z has just been updated to –z–1, and x′=x+y with y=previous z, so 
    f₁′ = x′ + z′ = (x + z₀) + (–z₀–1) = x – 1 < x + z = f₁.
– On even iterations z has just been reset to its original value z₀, and x′=x+y with y=previous z, so 
    f₂′ = x′ = x – 1 < x = f₂.  
Each phase’s ranking function is always non‐negative while that phase is active and strictly decreases, hence the loop must terminate.
