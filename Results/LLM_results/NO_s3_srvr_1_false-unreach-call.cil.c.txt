[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program contains a repeating loop with state transitions that can remain forever in a cycle or particular state without meeting a condition that ensures termination. Additionally, the function `ssl3_accept` includes nondeterministic transitions (using `__VERIFIER_nondet_int`) which do not guarantee that a state leading to termination will always be reached.
