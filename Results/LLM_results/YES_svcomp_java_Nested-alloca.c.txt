The program contains two nested loops. The outer loop increments `*i` from 0 to 9, and the inner loop starts with `*j` initialized to 3 and increments by 1 each time. The `*j` loop consists of a decrement (`*j -= 1`) and an increment (`*j += 2`), resulting in a net increment of 1 each iteration. This causes the inner loop to terminate once `*j` reaches 12, allowing the outer loop to continue its iteration. Both loops have clear decreasing ranking functions proving termination: the outer with respect to `*i` and the inner with respect to `*j`.
