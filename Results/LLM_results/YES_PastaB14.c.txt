[EXPLANATION]
– Inner loop “while (y>0)” is ranked by f₁(x,y)=y, which is non‐negative and decreases by 1 each iteration.  
– Outer loop “while (x==y && x>0)” is ranked by f₂(x,y)=x. At the start of the outer iteration x>0, and after the inner loop x=y=0 so f₂ strictly decreases to 0, causing the outer guard to fail.
