[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The condition `x < y` can remain true indefinitely if `x` is constantly increased at a slower rate than `y` is increased, which can happen if the `else` branch (`z = z + 1;`) is executed repeatedly, potentially keeping the loop condition true.

[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
nested
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 *  (y - x)^1 + 1.0 * 1
1.0 *  (z - x)^1 + 1.0 * 1

This program is terminating because within the while loop, either `x` is incremented or `z` is incremented, which results in `x` eventually reaching or exceeding `y`, causing the loop to exit.
