[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
There is an infinite execution: if the nondeterministic choice always picks the x += 1 branch, x grows without bound and never drops below 0, so the loop never terminates.

[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The nondeterministic choice can always pick the “else” branch, incrementing x forever and keeping x ≥ 0, yielding an infinite run.
