[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The variables `am` and `bm` can indefinitely oscillate without meeting the termination condition `am == bm` depending on the initial values of `a` and `b`. Specifically, if `a` and `b` are positive and different, `am` and `bm` can keep increasing without ever becoming equal.
