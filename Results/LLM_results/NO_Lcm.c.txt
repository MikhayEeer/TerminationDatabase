=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The loop can continue indefinitely when 'a' and 'b' are not equal and have different signs or are both zero, making 'am' and 'bm' not converge.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program can be non-terminating if \( a \) and \( b \) are positive integers that are not multiples of each other, causing the while loop to continue indefinitely as neither \( am \) nor \( bm \) will converge to an equal value.
