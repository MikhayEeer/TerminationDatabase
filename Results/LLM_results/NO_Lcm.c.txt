NONTERM
[REASON]
If one of a or b is zero and the other nonzero (e.g. a≠0, b=0), then bm or am never changes and the loop runs forever.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
For example, if a=0 and b≠0 then am remains 0 while bm changes (bm=b,bm=2b,…), so am≠bm forever and the loop never terminates.
