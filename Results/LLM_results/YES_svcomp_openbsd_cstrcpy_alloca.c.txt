linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * length2 + -1.0 * (to - save)

Explanation: In the loop of cstrcpy, “save” holds the initial value of to and “to” is incremented by 1 each iteration, so (to–save) measures the number of copies done. Since length2–(to–save) starts at length2>0 and decreases by 1 on each iteration, it is a valid linear ranking function.
