[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The main scheduler loop (`while (m_run_st==0 || s_run_st==0)`) only makes progress when the nondeterministic calls `__VERIFIER_nondet_int()` return nonzero. Since those calls may always return zero, the loop can spin forever without advancing `m_run_st` or `s_run_st`.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The `eval` function contains a loop  
  while (m_run_st==0 || s_run_st==0)  
that only advances when a nondeterministic choice (`__VERIFIER_nondet_int()`) returns true. If both calls return false indefinitely, that loop never exits, so the program can spin forever.
