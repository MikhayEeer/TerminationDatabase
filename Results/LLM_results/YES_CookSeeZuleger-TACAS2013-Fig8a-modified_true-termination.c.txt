|x - K|

This program is terminating because in each iteration of the loop, the absolute difference between `x` and `K` (i.e., `|x - K|`) decreases by exactly 1, regardless of whether `x` is greater or less than `K`. Since `|x - K|` is a non-negative integer that strictly decreases in every iteration, it serves as a linear ranking function ensuring termination. Eventually, `x` will become equal to `K`, and the loop will terminate.

|x - K|  

The program is terminating because, in each iteration of the loop, the absolute difference between `x` and `K` (`|x - K|`) strictly decreases by 1, which means it will eventually reach 0 when `x` equals `K`. This provides a linear ranking function showing the termination of the loop.
