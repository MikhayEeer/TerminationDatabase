TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
|x - K|

The program is terminating because the absolute difference between `x` and `K` decreases with every iteration of the loop. If `x` is greater than `K`, `x` is decremented, thus reducing the difference. If `x` is less than `K`, `x` is incremented, also reducing the difference. Therefore, this difference serves as a linear ranking function. Once `x` equals `K`, the loop terminates.

|x - K|  

This function uses the absolute difference between `x` and `K` as a linear ranking function which strictly decreases by exactly 1 in each iteration of the loop. This demonstrates that the program must terminate.
