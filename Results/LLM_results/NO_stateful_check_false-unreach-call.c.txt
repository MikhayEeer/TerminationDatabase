[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program contains an infinite loop due to the `while(__VERIFIER_nondet_int())`, which can non-deterministically evaluate to true perpetually, causing the loop to repeat indefinitely without termination. Additionally, the non-deterministic nature of the case switching does not guarantee progression through all operations in sequence, allowing for potential infinite cycles.
