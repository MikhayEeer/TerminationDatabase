[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
nested
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.  Ranking function for outer loop (x-loop): x
2.  Ranking function for inner loop (y-loop): y

Both loops have simple linear ranking functions. The inner loop decreases `y` from an initial positive integer to zero, which ensures termination of the inner loop. After the inner loop terminates, `x` is decremented by 1, which eventually reaches zero, ensuring termination of the outer loop.

[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * x^1 + 0.0 * y^1
0.0 * x^1 + 1.0 * y^1

This program is terminating and can be proved by the multi-phase ranking function. In the first phase, when `x > 0` and `y > 0`, `y` decreases until `y` reaches 0. In the second phase, `x` decreases until `x` reaches 0. Once both `x` and `y` reach 0, the program terminates.
