(x1 <= 10) -> 11 - x1
(x1 > 10) -> 0

Explanation:
This program consists of a nested loop structure. The outer loop runs while `x1 <= 10`, and within it, there is an inner loop that runs while `x2 > 1`. The inner loop decrements `x2` by 1 in each iteration, making sure it reaches 1 eventually, always terminating the inner loop. Each time after the inner loop finishes, `x1` is incremented by 1. Thus, the outer loop will make `x1` exceed 10 eventually, terminating the entire loop structure. The ranking function reflects that for `x1 <= 10`, the remaining steps to continue the loop structure are `11 - x1`. Once `x1 > 10`, the program terminates immediately.
