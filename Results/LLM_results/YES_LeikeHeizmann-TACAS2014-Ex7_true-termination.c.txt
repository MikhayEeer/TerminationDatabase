[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
2.0 * q + 1.0 * z^1
1.0 * q
```

This program is terminating. It has a multi-phase ranking function as detailed in the explanation provided in the comment of the code itself. The two-phase ranking function: 

1. \( f_0(x, y) = 2q + z \)
2. \( f_1(x, y) = q \)

This function ensures that during each cycle of the loop, the value strictly decreases which implies termination of the loop.
