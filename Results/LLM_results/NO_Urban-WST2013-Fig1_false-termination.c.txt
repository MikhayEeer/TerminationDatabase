=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program is non-terminating because if `x > 6` initially, `x` will keep increasing by 2 indefinitely while remaining less than or equal to 10, causing an infinite loop.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program does not update the variable `x` to decrease its value or make it exit the loop once `x <= 6`, and if `x` starts at a value `7 <= x <= 10`, then `x` enters an infinite loop since `x` keeps increasing by 2, making it impossible to exit the loop.
