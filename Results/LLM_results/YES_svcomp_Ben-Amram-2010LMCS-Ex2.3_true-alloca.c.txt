1) f₁(x,y,z) = (y > x ? 1 : 0)  
2) f₂(x,y,z) = z

Explanation of the lexicographic decrease:
- While y > x (“phase 1”), f₁ = 1 remains constant and z strictly decreases at each iteration in the “then” branch.
- As soon as y ≤ x (“phase 2”), f₁ drops from 1 to 0 (a strict decrease in the first component), and thereafter in the “else” branch z decreases strictly on every iteration, with f₁ staying at 0.
