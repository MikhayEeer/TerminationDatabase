case (curr→value != m): 1.0 * |reach(curr)|  
case (curr→value == m): 0.0  

Here |reach(curr)| denotes the number of nodes on the acyclic list from curr up to (and including) the unique node whose value equals m (in this program m = 0). On each loop iteration curr advances to curr→next, strictly decreasing |reach(curr)| by 1 until it reaches 0, at which point curr→value == m and the loop exits.

f(curr) = “the number of remaining next‐pointer steps from curr until reaching the first node whose value equals m”  

Explanation: the linked list built by init_list(n) is acyclic and always contains exactly one node with value == m (the very first node, initialized to 0).  In each iteration of search, curr moves along the next‐pointer, so f(curr) is a non‐negative integer that strictly decreases by 1 on every loop iteration and hence proves termination.
