multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
phase I: 1.0 * c^1  
phase II: 1.0 * (100 - n)^1  

Explanation:  
The program contains a multi-phase ranking function. Initially, when n > 100, the program decreases n by 10 while reducing c by 1, and when n â‰¤ 100, the program increases n by 11 while increasing c by 1. This alternating pattern eventually ensures that c decreases from positive integers to zero, terminating the loop. The two-phase ranking function first counts down c and adjusts n, eventually leading to a point where the loop exits when c reaches zero.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program can enter a non-terminating cycle. If `n` is initially greater than 100, `n` will decrease and `c` will eventually reach 0, causing the loop to terminate. However, if `n` is less than or equal to 100, `n` will keep increasing by 11 without a bound since `c` will increase as well, keeping it positive. Therefore, the loop can go on indefinitely.
