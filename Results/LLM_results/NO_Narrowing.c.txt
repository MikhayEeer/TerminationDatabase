[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The loop is non-terminating because the program creates a cycle between low values (close to 0) and high values (close to range). The variable `i` oscillates between these values due to the conditions and assignments within the loop, without a mechanism to ensure termination. Specifically, when `range` becomes 1, `i` oscillates between 0 and 1, never breaking out of the while loop.
