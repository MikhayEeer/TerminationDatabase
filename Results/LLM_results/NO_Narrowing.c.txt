Once range is decremented down to 1, the loop state oscillates between (i=0,range=1) and (i=1,range=1) without ever violating 0≤i≤range, so it never exits.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
Once range decrements down to 1, the loop invariants force i to alternate between 0 and 1 forever (up flips at 0 and 1) and the loop condition 0 ≤ i ≤ range (i.e. 0 ≤ i ≤ 1) never fails, so the loop never exits.
