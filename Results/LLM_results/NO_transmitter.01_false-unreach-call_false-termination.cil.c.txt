NONTERM
[REASON]
The main schedulerâ€™s eval() loop (while(exists_runnable_thread())) only advances a thread when __VERIFIER_nondet_int() returns true. If it repeatedly returns false, both threads remain runnable (st==0) and no state change ever occurs, yielding an infinite loop.

[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
In eval(), if both __VERIFIER_nondet_int() return 0 indefinitely, m_st and t1_st stay 0 so exists_runnable_thread() is always true, causing an infinite loop.
