[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program contains infinite loops: both `master` and `transmit1` functions have infinite loops that are not conditioned to exit or alter global states in a way that can be guaranteed to terminate. The cycles between scheduling and execution maintain potential non-termination despite attempts to control thread states and events.
