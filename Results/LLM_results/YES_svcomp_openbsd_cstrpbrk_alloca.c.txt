- 5.0 * length1^1 + 1.0 * 1
- 5.0 * length2^1 + 1.0 * 1

Explanation:
The `cstrpbrk` function iterates through `s1` until it encounters the null character `\0`, which signifies the end of the string. Each outer loop iteration examines a character from `s1`, then iterates through `s2` looking for a match. Once it traverses the entirety of `s1`, or finds a match, the function returns. This bounded behavior ensures termination. The provided lengths `length1` and `length2` are finite and positive due to their initialization and checks, which further assures the finite iteration of loops. The multi-phase ranking functions are based on reducing the remaining length of strings `s1` and `s2` upon each iteration.

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1. Lexicographic ranking function based on the position of the pointer `s1` within the string `nondetString1`.
2. Inner loop terminates based on the pointer `scanp` moving through the string `nondetString2`.

Explanation:
- The outer `while` loop iterates through the string `nondetString1` using the pointer `s1`. The loop condition (`(c = *s1++) != 0`) ensures that the loop will terminate when `s1` reaches the null character `'\0'`, which is deliberately placed at the end of the string.
- The inner `for` loop iterates through the string `nondetString2` with the pointer `scanp`. This loop also terminates because `scanp` reaches the null character placed at the end of `nondetString2`.
- Both `s1` and `scanp` have finite lengths, as ensured by their respective null character placements, so pointer increment operations guarantee progress toward termination.
