Phase 1: Lexicographic ranking function based on lengths `(length1, length2)`.  
Phase 2: Decrease in the position of the pointer `s1` towards its null character, which will eventually reach the end of `nondetString1`.

Explanation:  
The program initializes two strings `nondetString1` and `nondetString2` with lengths determined by nondeterministic integers `length1` and `length2`. The string `nondetString1` and `nondetString2` are null-terminated. The function `cstrpbrk` scans each character of `nondetString1` against all characters of `nondetString2`. The inner loop terminates when a matching character is found or the end of `nondetString2` is reached. The outer loop progresses by moving the pointer `s1` to the next character until it encounters the null character. The two-phase structure consists of initial potential execution by iterating over `s2` for each character in `s1`, followed by moving `s1` character by character to its end. Both of these phases are bounded by the finite lengths `length1` and `length2` of the strings, guaranteeing termination.

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
Phase 1: Decrease in the length of `s1` until a matching character is found or end of the string is reached.
Phase 2 (nested within Phase 1): Inner loop where `s2` is traversed entirely for each character of `s1`.

Explanation:
- The outer loop decreases the length of `s1` as it progresses through the string, ensuring termination because the loop iterates through a finite string.
- For each character in `s1`, the inner loop iterates over `s2`, which is also finite and can only have a bounded number of characters. Each complete iteration of the inner loop decreases the effective search space for the next phase of `s1`.
Thereby proving that the executed loop iterations have to eventually terminate.
