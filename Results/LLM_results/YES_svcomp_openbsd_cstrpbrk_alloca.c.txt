where x is the number of characters remaining in s1 before the NUL (i.e. the distance from the current s1‐pointer to its terminator) and y is the number of characters remaining in s2 before its NUL. The lexicographic pair (x,y) strictly decreases: in the inner loop y decreases to 0, and whenever y is reset, x decreases by one.

f₁ = length1 – (s1 – s1₀)  // measures remaining characters in s1  
f₂ = length2 – (scanp – s2₀) // measures remaining characters in s2  

Explanation of the nesting:
- In the inner loop (“for (scanp=…; (sc=…)!=0;)”), f₁ is invariant and f₂ strictly decreases on each iteration (since scanp advances until it hits the terminating NUL after at most length2 steps).  
- When the inner loop exits, scanp has reached the end of s2 and f₂ has reached 0; at that point the outer loop iteration either returns (if a match was found) or advances s1 by one (decreasing f₁ by 1) and resets scanp to s2₀ for the next inner‐loop phase.  
- f₁ strictly decreases on each full inner loop and remains nonnegative, so the outer loop also terminates after at most length1 iterations. Together this nested lexicographic pair (f₁, f₂) proves termination.
