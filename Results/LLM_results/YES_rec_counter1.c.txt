[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear  
[RANKING FUNCTION]  
a  

The function `rec(int a)` is recursive and decreases the value of `a` by 1 for each recursive call until it reaches 0, at which point it terminates. The ranking function `a` is linear in nature and decreases with every recursive call, ensuring termination of the program.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
nested  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
Main Function Call:  
1.0 * i^1

Recursive Function Call `rec(a)`:  
1.0 * a^1  

Inner While Loop within `rec(a)`:  
1.0 * rescopy^1  

The program is terminating since each call to `rec(a)` reduces `a` by 1, and the inner loop reduces `rescopy` to 0, providing a clear termination argument through nested ranking functions.
