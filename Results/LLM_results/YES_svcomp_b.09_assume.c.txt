[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * x + 1.0 * y, phase 1 (x > y)
1.0 * x, phase 2 (x <= y) 

The program terminates because, in the first phase when \(x > y\), the value of \(x\) is reduced to \(y\), and in the second phase when \(x <= y\), the value of \(x\) is decremented by 1 in each step until it reaches 0, at which point the loop exits. Therefore, the program has a well-defined multi-phase ranking function that ensures termination.

[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
piecewise  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
For the case when x > 0 and y > 0:  
1. `x` is decreased to zero in the while loop when `x <= y`.  

For the case when x <= 0 or y <= 0:  
1. The function exits immediately after the initial if condition.

The function achieves termination through a combination of different scenarios based on the initial values of `x` and `y`, resulting in a piecewise ranking that ensures a decrease towards termination.
