R(x,y) = y / x

This function is well‐founded on the loop domain x>0, x<y (so R>1), and under the update
  R′ = (y+1)/(2x) = ½·R + 1/(2x) < ½·R + ½ ≤ R
with strict decrease whenever R>1, and the loop exits exactly when R≤1.

-1.0 * x^1 + 0.0 * y^1 + 2.0 * 1
-1.0 * x^1 + 1.0 * y^1 + 0.0 * 1

Explanation of phases:
Phase 1 uses φ₁(x,y)=2−x, which is positive only when x=1 and strictly decreases to 0 when x doubles to ≥2.
Once x≥2 (φ₁≤0), Phase 2 takes over with φ₂(x,y)=y−x, which strictly decreases by at least 1 each iteration until y−x≤0, at which point the loop guard x<y fails.
