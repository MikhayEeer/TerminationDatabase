[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
non-linear  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
\( f(x, y) = y - x \)  

Explanation:  
The program is terminating because, during each iteration of the loop, the variable \( x \) is doubled while \( y \) is incremented by 1. Since \( x \) starts less than \( y \) and is doubled each iteration while \( y \) goes up by only 1, eventually \( x \) will be greater than or equal to \( y \). At that point, the loop condition will no longer hold true, leading to the termination of the loop. The non-linear ranking function \( f(x, y) = y - x \) is strictly decreasing as the loop progresses.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
non-linear  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
\( R(x, y) = y - \log_2(x) \)

Explanation: The loop condition is \(x > 0\) and \(x < y\). Inside the loop, \(x\) is doubled (i.e., \(x = 2 \times x\)), and \(y\) is incremented by 1. This is better understood by considering the log scale for \(x\). The ranking function is \(y - \log_2(x)\) which decreases at each step of the loop: \(y\) increases linearly, while \(\log_2(x)\) increases logarithmically, making the difference decrease and eventually terminate.
