f₁(x) = x mod 2  
f₂(x) = 255 – x  

Explanation of the lexicographic (nested) ranking:
- Phase 1: f₁(x)=1 when x is odd, 0 when x is even.  If x is odd, the loop does x→x–1 (even), so f₁ drops from 1 to 0.  
- Phase 2: once x is even (f₁=0), we use f₂(x)=255–x.  Each even step does x→x+2, so f₂ decreases by 2.  
Since (f₁,f₂) decreases lexicographically on every iteration and is bounded below by (0,0), the loop must terminate.

1) f₁(x) = x mod 2  
2) f₂(x) = 255 – x  

Explanation of decrease:  
- If x is odd then f₁(x)=1 and after one iteration x becomes even so f₁ drops to 0.  
- If x is even then f₁ stays 0 and f₂(x) = 255–x strictly decreases because x increases by 2.
