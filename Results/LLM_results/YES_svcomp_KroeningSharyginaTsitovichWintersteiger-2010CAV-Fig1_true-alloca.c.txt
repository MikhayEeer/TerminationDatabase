[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
255 - x

The program will eventually reach a condition where `*x` becomes greater than or equal to 255, at which point it exits the loop. The ranking function is linear, as shown above, and it establishes termination by progressively moving towards zero as the loop executes, given the constraints and operations inside the loop.
