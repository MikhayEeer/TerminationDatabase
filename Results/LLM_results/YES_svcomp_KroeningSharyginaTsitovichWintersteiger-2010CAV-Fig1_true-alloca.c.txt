Branch 1 (when `*x % 2 != 0` or `*debug != 0`): 
  255 - *x 
Branch 2 (when `*x % 2 == 0` and `*debug == 0`): 
  255 - *x

1. When \(*x \% 2 \neq 0\) (odd case), ranking function: \(-x\)  
2. When \(*x \% 2 = 0\) (even case),  ranking function: \(255 - x\)  

Explanation:  
1. If \(*x\) is odd, \(*x\) decreases by 1 in each iteration. This will eventually make it non-negative in the odd state, aiding termination.
2. If \(*x\) is even, \(*x\) increases by 2. Since the while loop continues only when \(*x < 255\), this increment will quickly reach 255, terminating the loop.   
3. The piecewise nature of these calculations ensures all paths lead to termination.
