[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
10 - i2

This program is terminating. The loop in the `main` function iterates 10 times, decreasing the counter `i2` from an initial value of 0 to 9. A simple linear ranking function `10 - i2` can be employed to demonstrate that the number of iterations is limited, rendering the program terminating.
