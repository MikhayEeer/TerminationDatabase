100 - i

The program is terminating because the outer `while` loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 100, effectively functioning as a countdown. The inner `while` loop is irrelevant to termination since `j` doesn't change, making it exit only when `j < 1` condition is checked once (since `j = 0` initially, it trivially satisfies the condition). Hence, the linear ranking function 100 - i demonstrates termination by decreasing with each iteration until `i` equals 100, at which point the loop terminates.
