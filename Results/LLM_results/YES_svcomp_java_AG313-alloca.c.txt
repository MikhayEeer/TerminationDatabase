=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * x_ref + 1.0 * y_ref

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
2.0 * 1 + 1.0 * (x - 1) * y^0 + 1.0 * (x - y)^0  
0.5 * x^1 + 1.0 * 0 + 0.5 * 1  

The program is terminating. The function computes the quotient of x divided by y, decrementing x by the value of y until x is non-positive or y is zero. The multi-phase ranking function shows progress toward termination.
