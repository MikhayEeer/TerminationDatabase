=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * x^1

Explanation: Inside the loop *x_ref strictly decreases by y_ref≥1 on each iteration and is bounded below by 0, so f(x)=x is a valid linear ranking function.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * x_ref^1

This ranking function maps the loop state to the current value of x_ref, which is always non‐negative on entry, strictly decreases by y_ref>0 each iteration, and thus proves termination.
