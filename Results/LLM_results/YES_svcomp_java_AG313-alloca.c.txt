x - y

The program is terminating because the function `quot` has a clear linear ranking function for each iteration of the loop, which is `x - y`. At each iteration, the loop decreases the value of `*x_ref` by `1`, and decreases `*y_ref` by `1` (through `*x_ref = (*x_ref - 1) - (*y_ref - 1);`, which simplifies to `*x_ref = *x_ref - *y_ref`). Since both `*x_ref` and `*y_ref` remain positive while in the loop and are non-increasing, the loop eventually terminates when `*x_ref` becomes non-positive while `*y_ref` is still positive. Hence, there is no possibility of infinite execution, confirming the program's termination.
