- If \(i > 5\), use: -\(i\)  
- If \(i < -5\), use: \(i\)  
- If \(-5 \leq i \leq 5\), use: a constant value as the loop terminates immediately.  

The loop terminates because `i` eventually reaches 0 when it falls within the range from -5 to 5. Prior to that, for `i > 5`, the value of `i` will keep increasing, and for `i < -5`, `i` will decrease, both of which bring `i` closer to the -5 to 5 range where the loop exits.

For i > 5: -i
For i < -5: i
For -5 ≤ i ≤ 5: i, stops immediately to 0 when i is within this range
