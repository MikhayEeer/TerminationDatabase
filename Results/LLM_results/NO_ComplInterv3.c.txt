[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
For any initial i>5 (resp. i<−5), the loop takes the branch i=i+1 (resp. i=i−1), moving i strictly away from 0 forever, so it never exits.

[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
If i>5 it is incremented forever (never reaches 0); if i<–5 it is decremented forever (never reaches 0).
