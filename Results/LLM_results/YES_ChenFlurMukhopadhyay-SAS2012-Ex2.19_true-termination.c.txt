[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * (x + y)   
This program is terminating as the termination can be proved using a multi-phase ranking function. Here, the condition `(x + y) > 0` ensures that the loop iterates as long as the sum is positive. In each iteration, `x` is decremented by 1, and `y` is doubled negatively, thereby decreasing the sum repeatedly until it eventually becomes non-positive, i.e., the loop terminates.
