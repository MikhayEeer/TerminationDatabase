– Case y > 0: R(x,y) = (x+y)/(2·y) + 1  
– Case y < 0: R(x,y) = (x+y)/(−2·y)  
– Case y = 0: R(x,y) = x

Explanation sketch:  
  • Whenever y = 0 the loop behaves like x:=x−1 and x+y>0 forces x to decrease to ≤0.  
  • If y≠0 then in one step y′=−2y, so |y′|=2|y|, and one checks by simple algebra that in each of the two nonzero cases  
    R(x′,y′) < R(x,y)  
  holds whenever x+y>0.  Since R is always positive on states satisfying the loop‐guard, this gives a well‐founded, strictly decreasing variant and hence the loop terminates.
