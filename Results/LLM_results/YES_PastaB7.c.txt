=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
x + y - 2 * z

The given program terminates as both variables `x` and `y` decrease by 1 in every loop iteration while being greater than the variable `z`. The ranking function `x + y - 2 * z` is linear and strictly decreases with each iteration, leading to eventual termination of the loop.
