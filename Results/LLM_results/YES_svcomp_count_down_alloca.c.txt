[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * (i - length)^1 + 1.0 * 1
1.0 * (j - length)^1 + 1.0 * 1
1.0 * arr[j]^1 + 1.0 * 1

Explanation:
1. The first phase of the ranking function is for the loop controlling `i`, which iterates from `0` to `length - 1`. The ranking function decreases as `i` increases towards `length`, ensuring that the outer loop terminates.

2. The second phase of the ranking function is for the loop controlling `j`, which similarly iterates from `0` to `length - 1`. The ranking function decreases as `j` increases towards `length`, ensuring that this loop terminates too.

3. The third phase is for the nested loop `while (arr[j] > 0)`, which decrements `arr[j]` in each iteration. This function decreases as `arr[j]` goes to zero in each position `j`, ensuring that the inner loop terminates.

Hence, the entire program is proven to be terminating.

[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
lexicographical
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
(length - j, arr[j])

The program will terminate because:
1. The outer loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `length-1`, which terminates after `length` iterations.
2. The inner loop decreases `arr[j]` to `0` and terminates because for any `arr[j] > 0`, the loop makes `arr[j]` strictly smaller, and it's bounded below by `0`.

The lexicographical ranking function first ensures the outer loop decreases, thereby making progress towards termination, while the inner counter offers the secondary guarantee that any `arr[j]` value will eventually decrease to zero for each fixed `j`.
