1.0 * x^1 + 0.0
- This ranking function shows that each recursive call to `id` or `id2` decreases the argument `x` by 1, thus ensuring that the recursion will eventually terminate.
- The recursion limits the output to a maximum of 2 due to the conditional `if (ret > 2) return 2;`, ensuring no error occurs when `result == 3`.

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
For the recursive function `id(x)` and `id2(x)`, a piecewise argument can be constructed based on the value of `x`:

1. Repeated recursion paint a picture of a bounded computation:

   - `id(x)` or `id2(x)` will reduce `x` by 1 at each call, indicating a decrementing sequence.
   - The cap condition: If the result exceeds 2, the functions immediately bound it to 2.
   
2. Specifically focusing on the positive value sequence, decrementing `x` and comparisons bound any possible run length. 

3. As `id()` and `id2()` alternate calls between each other with the only state change occurring in `x`, which is naturally bounded downwards, it guarantees termination without increasing indefinitely beyond a certain point.

Thus, no possible looping arises given these constraints, affirming termination.

Note: This structure or reasoning could represent a general understanding, but a strict numeric ranking was simplified in context representation, given mixed function recursion is inherently complex without tracing complete paths through an isolated, closed form.
