[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
When i == –5 the loop guard (i<0) holds but i is not updated, so execution gets stuck in an infinite loop (and any i<–5 is incremented to –5 and then loops forever).

[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
When i reaches –5 the loop guard (i<0) remains true but i is not updated, so an infinite loop (fixed point at i = –5) is possible.
