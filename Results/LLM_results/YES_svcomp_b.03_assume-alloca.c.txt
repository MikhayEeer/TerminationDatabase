=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The loop condition `*x_ref > *y_ref` may always hold as `*y_ref` is incremented by `*x_ref`, potentially never allowing `*x_ref > *y_ref` to become false. If `*x_ref` starts positive and `*y_ref` starts negative with `|y_ref| < x_ref`, the loop continues indefinitely, causing non-termination.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program contains a path where the value of `x_ref` remains unchanged and `y_ref` continuously increases, allowing the loop condition `*x_ref > *y_ref` to remain true indefinitely.
