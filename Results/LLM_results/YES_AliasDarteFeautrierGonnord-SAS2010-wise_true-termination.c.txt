=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * |x - y|^1 + 0.0 * 1 

This means the program is terminating, and the termination can be proved using a multi-phase ranking function, where the absolute difference between `x` and `y` decreases in each iteration of the loop until the condition `x - y > 2 || y - x > 2` is no longer satisfied.
