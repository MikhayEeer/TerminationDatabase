[REASON]
There is an execution that always takes one of the first four branches (increments x) and never the break, so x stays ≥0 and the loop runs forever.

[REASON]
The nondeterministic tests can repeatedly take one of the x+=1..4 branches forever (always keeping x≥0), so the loop may never break.
