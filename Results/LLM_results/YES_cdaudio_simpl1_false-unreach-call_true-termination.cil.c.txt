[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
4.0 - attempt

This ranking function shows that in the only unbounded loop (in CdAudioStartDevice) the local variable attempt starts at 0 and strictly increases on each iteration, and since 4.0 − attempt is non‐negative and decreases by at least 1 each time, the loop must terminate—and no other infinite loops exist in the program.
