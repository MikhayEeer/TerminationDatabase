[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The main function contains an infinite loop due to lack of a viable exit condition from the switch-case logic, leading to nontermination under certain input conditions. Additionally, various non-deterministic functions could preserve the program state indefinitely, maintaining conditions for repeated executions without a halt.
