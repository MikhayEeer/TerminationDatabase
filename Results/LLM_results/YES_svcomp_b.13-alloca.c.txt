=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
0.5 *  x^1 + 0.5 *  y^1 - 1.0 *  z^1  
0.5 *  x^1 - 1.0 *  z^1  
0.5 *  y^1 - 1.0 *  z^1  

This program is terminating because the values of `*x_ref` and `*y_ref` are continually decreasing with respect to the constant value of `*z_ref` whenever they are greater than `*z_ref`, leading to the eventual satisfaction of the loop exit condition `(*x_ref <= *z_ref)` and `(*y_ref <= *z_ref)`. The combination and order of the reductions in `*x_ref` and `*y_ref` relative to `*z_ref` establish a multi-phase ranking function, proving termination.
