1.0 *  (30 - a)^1 + 0.0 * 1 + 0.0 * 1
1.0 *  (a - b)^1 + 0.0 * 1 + 0.0 * 1

The program terminates as follows: 

1. The outer while-loop decreases the value of \(30 - a\) because once \(b\) is greater than or equal to \(a\), \(a\) is strictly increased by at least \(2\) in each iteration of the outer loop until \(a \geq 30\).

2. The inner while-loop decreases the value of \(a - b\) because it increases \(b\) at a faster rate compared to the increase in \(a\). Once \(b\) catches up to \(a\), the inner while-loop terminates, allowing the outer loop to progress in making \(a \geq 30\). 

Thus, both loops consistently reduce their respective ranking functions, ensuring termination.
