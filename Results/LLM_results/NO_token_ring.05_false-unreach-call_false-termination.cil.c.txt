=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The `master` and `transmit` functions contain infinite loops that continuously execute without a condition to break out of them. Additionally, each thread's waiting and execution conditions do not coerce termination naturally, and thus the simulation does not have a natural termination without external intervention or specific conditions met which aren't satisfied based on the provided code.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The master and transmit functions contain infinite loops without any condition to break out, potentially leading to non-termination of the program.
