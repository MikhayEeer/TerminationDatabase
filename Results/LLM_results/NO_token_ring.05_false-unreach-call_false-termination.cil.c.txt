=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The `start_simulation` loop (`while(1)`) never empties `exists_runnable_thread`: master and the five transmit threads form a never-ending ping-pong cycle, so the scheduler always finds a runnable thread and never terminates.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The scheduler’s eval loop may repeatedly call __VERIFIER_nondet_int() and never schedule any thread (always returning 0), so exists_runnable_thread() remains true but no st is changed—leading to an infinite loop.
