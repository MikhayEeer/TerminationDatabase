[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
– Phase 1: f₁(n,m) = max(0, –m)  
– Phase 2: f₂(n,m) = m  

Explanation:  
In calls with m<0, f₁ decreases from –m>0 to 0 (when m becomes –m>0), and thereafter f₁ stays at 0 while f₂(m)=m strictly decreases by 1 in each recursive step until it reaches 0.

[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  

[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
nested  

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * (m < 0 ? 1 : 0)  
1.0 * (m >= 0 ? m : -m)  

Explanation:  
– On a call mult(n, m) with m<0, the first component goes from 1 to 0 (strict decrease), moving into phase 2.  
– Once m≥0, the first component stays 0 and the second component |m| decreases by 1 on each recursive call until it reaches 0.  
Thus the pair (I[m<0], |m|) is a valid nested (lexicographic) ranking function.
