[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
The function `mult(n, m)` is recursively called with the value of 'm' strictly decreasing in each call, which acts as a ranking function. 
- For `mult(n, m)`, if `m < 0`, it transforms to `mult(n, -m)`. 
- If `m == 0`, the function returns 0.
- Otherwise, `mult(n, m - 1)` is called, each time reducing `m` by 1, ensuring that it's moving towards the base case `m == 0`.

Since the recursive calls decrease the value of `m` and eventually reach the base case where `m == 0`, the recursion will terminate. The main function relies on conditions that ensure the computations complete without infinite loops or unhandled recursions.

1.0 * m^1 + 0.0 * 1
1.0 * n^1 + 0.0 * 1

Explanation:
The program performs multiplication of two integers using a recursive technique that repeatedly adds. The recursion involves decreasing the second argument `m` until it becomes zero, at which point it contributes zero to the sum. We use two phases for the ranking function corresponding to the recursive calls:
  
1. The first phase handles negative `m` by negating it, successfully directing towards positive `m`.
2. The second phase reduces `m` from its current value towards zero.

Both rankings strictly decrease for each recursive call towards a base case of `m == 0`, implying termination of recursion. The main function handles non-negative integers `m` and `n`, ensuring the recursive process progresses toward this base case. There is no possibility of non-termination under these rules as each call decreases the phase strictly by 1.
