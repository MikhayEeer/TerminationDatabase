[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
n 

The program is terminating because the Fibonacci function calculations (`fibo1` and `fibo2`) recursively reduce the value of `n` until they reach a base case (`n < 1` or `n == 1`). Each recursive call decreases `n` by 1 or 2, eventually reaching the terminating condition. The linear ranking function `n` ensures termination since the value of `n` is always decreasing and bounded by its base cases.

[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * n^1 + 0.0 * 1 + 0.0 * 1

Explanation:

The recursive Fibonacci computation is based on decrementing the input value `n` until hitting base cases (`n < 1` or `n == 1`). Each recursive call decreases the value of `n`, ensuring that eventually, all calls will hit the base cases, causing termination. The multi-phase ranking function handles the multiple recursive calls efficiently.
