=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * n

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * n^1

Explanation: In every recursive call to either fibo1 or fibo2 the argument `n` strictly decreases (from n to n–1 or n–2), so the linear function f(n)=n is a global ranking function proving termination.
