1.0 * length1 – 1.0 * (s1 – s1₀)

Explanation of the ranking function:
• We view cstrcmp as iterating a pointer s1 from its initial value s1₀ up to the terminating '\0' at most length1–1 steps.  
• At each loop iteration s1 advances by one, so (s1 – s1₀) increases by 1 and R = length1 – (s1 – s1₀) strictly decreases by 1.  
• R is initially ≤ length1 and remains non-negative, hence proves the loop must terminate.

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * ( length1 − (s1 − s1₀) )

Explanation:
Let s1₀ be the initial value of s1 on entry to the loop, and length1 the length of the first string buffer. Define 
  f(s1) = length1 − (s1 − s1₀).
Each iteration of the while‐loop increments s1 by 1, so f decreases by exactly 1. Since s1 stops advancing as soon as *s1=='\0' (and length1−(s1−s1₀)≥0 initially), f is a non‐negative integer that strictly decreases on each loop iteration, hence the loop must terminate.
