[RANKING FUNCTION]  
Lexicographic order of characters in the strings

The function `cstrcmp` and `main` will always terminate because `cstrcmp` iterates through the characters of both input strings until it finds a differing character or reaches the null terminator (`'\0'`). Since `main` initializes the last character of both strings to `'\0'`, there will always be a stopping condition for the while loop inside `cstrcmp`. Thus, the process will terminate after traversing through the strings at most up to their null terminators.

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
Decrease in the length of the strings compared by `cstrcmp`.  

Explanation:

The function `cstrcmp` compares two strings character by character and stops when it finds a difference or encounters the null terminator ('\0') of either string. In the main function, two strings `nondetString1` and `nondetString2` of non-deterministically chosen lengths (minimally 1 due to the check) are passed to `cstrcmp`. The strings have a null terminator set at their last position.

The loop within `cstrcmp` will iterate as long as the current characters from both strings being compared are equal and not the null terminator. This will either reach a differing character, leading to a return based on the difference, or it will reach the end of one or both strings due to the null terminator.

The loop decreases as it scans characters, effectively moving toward the null terminator, thus ensuring it will eventually terminate. Therefore, this loop in `cstrcmp` will always terminate due to the linear decrease in the remaining length of the strings.
