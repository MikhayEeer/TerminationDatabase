=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The outer loop increments `*x_ref` indefinitely since `*x_ref` starts at `x` and continues to increase without a condition that enforces termination (it only decrements by 2 after the inner loop but increments by 1 at the start of the loop). The outer condition `*x_ref >= 0` is permanently satisfied once `*x_ref` is sufficiently large, causing non-termination.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The outer loop potentially runs indefinitely, as *x_ref is incremented by 1 and then decremented by 2. The initial increase allows it to grow indefinitely if it starts from a sufficiently large positive number, causing non-termination.
