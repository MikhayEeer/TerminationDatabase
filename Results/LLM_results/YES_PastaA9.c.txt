[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
z - x

The program is terminating because within the `while` loop, the variable `z` is increased by `y` in each iteration. Since `y > 0`, `z` will eventually become greater than `x`, thus breaking the loop condition `x >= z`. This can be shown formally with the linear ranking function `z - x`, which decreases (actually, becomes more positive) on each iteration of the loop, since `z` increases with each iteration.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The loop `while (x >= z) { z = z + y; }` will not terminate if `y > 0` and `x < z` is initially false, because `z` keeps increasing by `y` and never decreases, so the condition `x >= z` will always remain true.
