TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1st Phase: *y_ref > 0, with ranking function y_ref
2nd Phase: *x_ref > 0, after y_ref reaches 0, with ranking function x_ref

The program terminates as it has two nested loops: the inner loop decreases *y_ref in each iteration until it reaches zero. Once *y_ref becomes zero, the control exits the inner loop, decreases *x_ref and resets *y_ref before the outer loop iterates again. The total number of iterations is finite as both *x_ref and *y_ref are decreased in a well-defined manner, reaching zero eventually, ensuring termination.

[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
nested
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
Outer loop: \( f_1(x) = x \)
Inner loop: \( f_2(y) = y \)

The program is terminating because for the outer loop, the ranking function \( f_1(x) = x \) strictly decreases with each iteration, and the inner loop terminates when \( y \) reaches zero, with the ranking function \( f_2(y) = y \) strictly decreasing in each iteration. The nested structure of the loops ensures that the program concludes execution when both \( x \) and \( y \) are zero.
