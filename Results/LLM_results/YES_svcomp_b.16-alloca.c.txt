TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
nested  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * x^1  
1.0 * y^1  

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
Phase 1: y^1 (decreases until y reaches 0, bringing us to the condition x>0)  
Phase 2: x^1 (decreases until x reaches 0, at which point the loop terminates)  

The program is terminating as it has an outer loop controlled by `x` which decreases its value until it reaches 0, and an inner loop controlled by `y` which also decreases until 0. The ranking functions provided are in two phases: first the inner loop with respect to `y`, and then the outer loop with respect to `x`.
