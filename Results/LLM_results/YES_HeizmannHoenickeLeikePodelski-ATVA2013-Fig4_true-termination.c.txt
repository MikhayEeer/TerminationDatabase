=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * x^1 - 1.0 * y^1

This ranking function `1.0 * x - 1.0 * y` proves termination. Initially, `x >= y` holds, and with each iteration of the loop, `x` is decremented by 1. This makes the value of the function decrease, and eventually, `x` will be less than `y`, causing the loop to terminate.
