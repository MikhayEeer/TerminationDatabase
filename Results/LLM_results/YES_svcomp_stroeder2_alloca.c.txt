[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1 - 1.0 * i^1 (in the outer loop)
5 - 1.0 * *p^1 (in the inner loop)

The program is terminating because:

1. The outer loop, iterating over the range from 0 to `array_size - 1`, will always terminate as `i` is incremented in each iteration and `array_size` is finite and non-negative after the check in `main`.
2. The inner loop, decrements the third byte of each integer until it becomes non-positive, ensuring termination for each inner loop pass. Since bytes have an upper limit, this loop will always stop after a finite number of decrements.

These ranking functions guarantee a decrease towards termination in both loops and the transitions are bounded.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
nested
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1. Decrement of each byte in the loop: (*p) decreases to 0 upon each iteration.
2. The loop over `i` from 0 to `array_size - 1`, which is a bounded loop. 

The program is guaranteed to terminate because for each `i` in the loop `for (i = 0; i < array_size; i++)`, the inner while loop `while (*p > 0)` is decremented until `*p` becomes zero, thus ensuring eventual termination. The outer loop iterates a fixed number of times determined by the bounded `array_size`.
