Region1 (x>0, y>=0):   1.0 * x + 1.0 * y + 0.0  
Region2 (x>0, y<0):    1.0 * x + 0.0 * y + 0.0  
Region3 (x<=0, y>0):   0.0 * x + 1.0 * y + 0.0  

Explanation of the piecewise ranking function “r” on each loop iteration:

- If x>0 and y>=0, r = x+y ≥1, and the loop body decrements x by 1 so r↓ by 1.
- If x>0 and y<0, r = x ≥1, and again x↓ by 1 so r↓ by 1.
- If x<=0 and y>0, r = y ≥1, and the loop body decrements y by 1 so r↓ by 1.

In every reachable state of the loop r is a non-negative integer, strictly decreases on each iteration, and once x≤0 and y≤0 the loop exits. Hence the program terminates.
