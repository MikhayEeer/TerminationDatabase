-1 * (12 - j) + 0 * 1 + 0 * 1

[EXPLANATION]
The loop is controlled by both `i` and `j`. The outer loop (`i`) runs a fixed number of times (10 iterations), and the inner loop (`j`) effectively decreases by 1 in every iteration until it reaches 11. As each iteration of the nested loop decreases the distance of `j` to 12, it ensures that the loop will eventually exit once `j` reaches the stopping criteria of the inner `for` loop. This behavior can be captured by a linear ranking function that models the decrease in `j`.
