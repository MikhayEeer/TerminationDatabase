[REASON]
The transformation function `x = -2*x + 10` inside the loop will not always lead 'x' to a value less than 0. For instance, if `x = 5`, it remains 0 in the next iteration, leading it to cycle "0, 10, -20, 50, -90, 190, -370,...". Therefore, the loop may run indefinitely depending on the initial value of `x`.
