For all x satisfying the loop‐guard (x ≥ 0), we define a natural‐valued measure f(x) by cases as follows:

 1) If x ≥ 6 then f(x) = 1  
 2) If 4 ≤ x ≤ 5 then f(x) = 3  
 3) If 2 ≤ x ≤ 3 then f(x) = 4  
 4) If x = 1       then f(x) = 3  
 5) If x = 0       then f(x) = 2  

One checks by exhaustion on these finitely many regions that whenever x ≥ 0 and x′=−2·x+10, we have f(x′)<f(x), and of course f(x)>0 in each case.  Hence the loop must terminate.
