The program is implementing the Ackermann function, which is known to terminate for the range of inputs specified (m between 0 and 3, and n between 0 and 23). The decreasing complexity of the recursive calls in conjunction with the bounded input guarantees termination. Therefore, the program will eventually terminate for all allowed input values.
