The Ackermann function is known to always terminate for non-negative integer inputs. In this implementation, the values of `m` and `n` are constrained to specific ranges (0 to 3 for `m` and 0 to 23 for `n`), ensuring that the recursive calls always terminate. The recursion eventually reaches the base case returning a result. Although this program calls a function in a nested manner, one can argue the termination based on known properties of the Ackermann function and bounded input space without explicitly providing a numeric ranking function.

First phase: Function terminates quickly for fixed values of m and n, since it either decrements m and sets n to a smaller value or decrements n.
Second phase: Outer calls with m decrement eventually reaching m == 0, ensuring termination by hitting the base case or reducing to simpler subproblems. 

The Ackermann function terminates because:

1. When `m == 0`, the function returns immediately with `n + 1`.
2. When `n == 0`, the function reduces the problem to `ackermann(m-1, 1)`.
3. In the general case, `ackermann(m, n) = ackermann(m-1, ackermann(m, n-1))`, which eventually reduces both `m` and `n` due to the recursive structure, ensuring that the function eventually reaches the base case where `m == 0`. 
4. The bounds in `main` ensure the program operates on finite, predictable inputs, guaranteeing termination.
