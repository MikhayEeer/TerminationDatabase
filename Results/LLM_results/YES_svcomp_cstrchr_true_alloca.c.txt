This program is terminating. The loop in the `cstrchr` function iterates over the string `s` until it either finds the character `c` or reaches the end of the string. The character pointer `s` moves forward by one position with each iteration, which guarantees that the loop will eventually terminate when `s` reaches the null-terminating character at the end of the string (denoted by `'\0'`).

The length of the string `s` in `cstrchr` decreases with each iteration of the loop via `s++`, eventually reaching the null terminator `\0`, thus ensuring termination.
