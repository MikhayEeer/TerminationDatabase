length - (s - s0)

[EXPLANATION]
In the function cstrchr, let s0 be the initial value of the pointer s (the start of the string) and length ≥1 the string length. Define the ranking function

  R(s,length) = length − (s − s0).

Since each loop iteration increments s by 1, R decreases by exactly 1, staying non-negative (it reaches 0 when s points at the ‘\0’ terminator), hence it is a valid linear ranking function proving termination.

R(s) = (length − 1) − (s − nondetString)

Explanation:
– Let start = nondetString, end = start + (length−1) (where the '\0' is).  
– Define the ranking function R(s) = end − s = (length−1) − (s − start).  
– Initially R(s) ≥ 0, and each loop iteration increments s by 1, strictly decreasing R(s) by 1.  
– When s reaches end, *s=='\0' and the loop exits. Thus R(s) is a valid (linear) ranking function proving termination.
