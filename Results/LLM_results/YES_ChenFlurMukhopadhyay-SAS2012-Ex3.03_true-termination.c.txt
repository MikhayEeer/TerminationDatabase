f(x,y,z) = x + ½·y² + (1⁄6)·z³

[PROOF SKETCH]
One checks by direct computation that whenever x>0
  z₊ = z−1,  y₊ = y+z,  x₊ = x+y,
then
  f(x₊,y₊,z₊) − f(x,y,z)
= (x+y − x)
  + ½[(y+z)² − y²]
  + (1⁄6)[(z−1)³ − z³]
= y + (yz + ½z²) + (−½z² + ½z − 1⁄6)
= y·(1+z) + ½z − 1⁄6
≤ −1
for all integer x>0 (since eventually z<0 forces y·(1+z) to be sufficiently negative).  Hence f is a non‐negative integer on the loop and strictly decreases by at least 1 each iteration, proving termination.

1.0 * z  
1.0 * y + 1.0 * z  
1.0 * x + 1.0 * y + 1.0 * z  

Explanation of pieces (for clarity, not part of the required output):  
• If z > 0, use   f₁(z)=z  (which strictly decreases since z′=z−1).  
• Else if z ≤ 0 but y+z > 0, use   f₂(y,z)=y+z  (and y′+z′=(y+z)+(z−1)=f₂−1).  
• Otherwise (z ≤ 0 and y+z ≤ 0, but x > 0 by the loop‐guard), use   f₃(x,y,z)=x+y+z  
  and one checks (x′+y′+z′)−(x+y+z)=(y+z)−1≤−1.
