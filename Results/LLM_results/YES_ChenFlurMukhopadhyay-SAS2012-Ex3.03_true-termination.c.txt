=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
piecewise  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
If \( z \leq 0 \):  
  \[ (x - y \cdot (\frac{z \cdot (z + 1)}{2}))^1 \]  

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
(1) Phase 1: 3.0 * z^2 + 3.0 * x^2 (Rank function decreases in the second phase once z becomes sufficiently negative)
(2) Phase 2: 1.0 * x^1 (Rank function decreases linearly with x once y and z have sufficiently small growth impact on x)
