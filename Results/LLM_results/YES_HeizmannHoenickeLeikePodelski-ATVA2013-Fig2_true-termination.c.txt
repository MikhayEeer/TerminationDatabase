=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
x + 42

The linear ranking function \( x + 42 \) becomes strictly decreasing as the loop progresses, ensuring the termination of the loop. Initially, \( x = y + 42 \), which is non-negative since \( x \geq 0 \). As the loop executes, \( x \) will eventually become negative, causing the loop to terminate.

[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 *  x^1
