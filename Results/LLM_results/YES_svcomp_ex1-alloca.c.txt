[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * y^1  

Explanation: The loop in the function `test_fun` iterates while the value of `*y_ref` is greater than zero, and with each iteration, `*y_ref` is decremented by 1. This ensures that it will eventually reach zero, making the loop terminate. Thus, a linear ranking function based on `y` is used to prove termination.
