TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
lexicographic  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
(x1, x2) with decreasing ranking in lexicographic order:  
- First ranking function: 0.0 * 1 + 1.0 * (10 - x1)^1  
- Second ranking function: 0.0 * 1 + 1.0 * (*x2 - 1)^1  

Explanation: In the nested loops, the inner loop decreases the value of *x2 until it reaches 1, while the outer loop increases *x1 until it exceeds 10. The lexicographic ranking function demonstrates that the program terminates because each iteration of the outer loop makes progress toward termination by decreasing the first component of the lexicographic tuple, and within the inner loop, the second component decreases until the loop exits.
