x - max(y, z)  

This ranking function, `x - max(y, z)`, decreases by 1 on each iteration of the loop as both `y` and `z` are incremented while `x` remains constant. Once `x` is no longer greater than `max(y, z)`, the loop terminates.

[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
x - max(y, z)

The program is terminating because the value of `x - max(y, z)` strictly decreases in each iteration of the loop, where `max(y, z)` represents the maximum of the two variables `y` and `z`. Initially, `x > y` and `x > z`, and in each iteration, both `y` and `z` are incremented by 1, reducing the difference `x - max(y, z)` by 1. Eventually, this difference becomes zero or negative, causing the loop condition `(x > y) && (x > z)` to become false, thus terminating the loop.
