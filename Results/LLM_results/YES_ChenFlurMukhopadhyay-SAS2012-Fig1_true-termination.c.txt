z ≥ 0 : 1.0 * x + 1.0 * y + 1.0 * z + 1000.0  
z <  0 : 1.0 * x + 1.0 * y – 1.0 * z + 999.0

Explanation of decrease:
– If z ≥ 0 then z′ = –z –1 < 0, and  
 f₁′ = x′ + y′ + z′ + 1000  
  = (x+y) + z + (–z –1) + 1000  
  = (x + y + z + 1000) – 1  
 = f₁ – 1.  
– If z < 0 then z′ = –z –1 ≥ 0, and  
 f₂′ = x′ + y′ – z′ + 999  
  = (x+y) + z – (–z –1) + 999  
  = (x + y – z + 999) + (3z + 1)  
 Since z ≤ –1, 3z + 1 ≤ –2, so f₂′ ≤ f₂ – 2.  
In both cases the chosen piecewise function is bounded below (by ≥0 on all states satisfying x>0) and decreases by at least 1 on each iteration, hence the loop terminates.
