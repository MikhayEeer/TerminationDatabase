[RANKING FUNCTION]
f(x, y, z) = x + 1

The program is terminating. The ranking function `f(x, y, z) = x + 1` decreases with every iteration of the loop given the loop conditions `x >= 0` and `x + y >= 0`. As `x` decreases when `y` and `z` are nondeterministically assigned, and `y` is reassigned a value that decreases in the loop, eventually `x` will become less than zero or `x + y` will become less than zero, thus terminating the loop.
