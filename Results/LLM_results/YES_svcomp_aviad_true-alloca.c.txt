1 * a_ref

The program is terminating as the ranking function `a_ref` decreases by at least 1 in each iteration of the loop until it reaches 1, whereupon the loop terminates. The variable `a_ref` starts from `a` and is decreased either by dividing by 2 (when even) or decrementing by 1 (when odd). Since this process is guaranteed to eventually reach 1 for any positive initial integer `a`, the function `f` terminates.
