[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program contains a loop where `y` is set to `x+1` in each iteration. This condition (`x > y`) will always be true if `x` is a nondeterministic positive integer greater than or equal to 0. Hence, the loop does not have a valid termination condition, leading to non-termination.
