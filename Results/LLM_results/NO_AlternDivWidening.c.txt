If |i₀|>5 then each loop iteration does |i|:=|i|+1 and w:=w+1, so |i|−w remains >0 forever and the loop never reaches |i|≤w to terminate.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
If |i₀|>5 then each two iterations i is replaced by i+2 (or −i+2) while w increases by 2, so |i|−w remains constant positive and never falls into [−w..w], hence i never becomes 0.
