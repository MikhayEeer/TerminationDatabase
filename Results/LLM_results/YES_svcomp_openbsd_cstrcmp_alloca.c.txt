[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * length1 + -1.0 * (s1 - nondetString1)

Explanation:
We observe that in each iteration of the `while (*s1 == *s2++)` loop in `cstrcmp`, both pointers advance by exactly one position (when the bytes match and are non‐zero).  If we let nondetString1 be the original value of `s1` on entry, then the quantity

    f = length1 − (s1 − nondetString1)

is a non‐negative integer and decreases by 1 on every loop iteration.  Hence it is a valid linear ranking function proving that the loop—and therefore the whole program—must terminate.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * length1 + 1.0 * length2 + -1.0 * idx1 + -1.0 * idx2

where idx1 = (s1 – base_address_of_nondetString1) and idx2 = (s2 – base_address_of_nondetString2). This function is always non‐negative upon loop entry and decreases by 2 on every iteration, proving termination.
