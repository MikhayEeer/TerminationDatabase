[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program enters into a potentially infinite loop if `*tmp` keeps cycling back to `0` after exceeding `*maxId`, and `*tmp != *id` and the nondeterministic condition `__VERIFIER_nondet_int()` always return `true`. Thus, the loop can keep iterating indefinitely without any guarantee of termination.
