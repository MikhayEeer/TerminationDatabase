The loop can be non-terminating for specific inputs, such as x = -1 and y = 0, where the condition x < y will always be true, and the variables do not change in a way that affects the loop condition.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program is non-terminating for the initial values x = -1 and y = 0 since the loop condition x < y will always be false for these values, meaning the loop does not execute at all. For some other values, such as x = 0 and y = 1, the variables can result in an infinite loop with x alternating, while y eventually reaches 0, causing the loop to continue indefinitely, unable to exit the condition x < y.
