[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The state x=−1, y=0 satisfies x<y and is preserved by the body (x:=x+y=−1, y:=y/2=0), yielding an infinite loop.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
For example, with x = -1 and y = 0 each iteration leaves x = -1 and y = 0, so the condition x < y remains true forever.
