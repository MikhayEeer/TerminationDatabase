f(x, y) = 2 * x + y  

The given program is terminating. The function \( f(x, y) = 2 * x + y \) serves as a linear ranking function, which strictly decreases in each iteration of the loop, as \( x \) decreases by at least 2 and \( y \) is non-negative and also decreases, ensuring that \( f(x, y) \) eventually becomes negative, terminating the loop.
