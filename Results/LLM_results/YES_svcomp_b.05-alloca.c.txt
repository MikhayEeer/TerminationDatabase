[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The condition `x == 2*(*tmp_ref)` in the loop can continuously become true due to calls to `__VERIFIER_nondet_int()`, allowing the loop to execute indefinitely if `x_ref` is initially positive and `x` non-deterministically remains double the value of `tmp_ref` refelected in memory via `*tmp_ref`.
