1st level: i (where i goes from (array_size - 1) to 0 decreasing)
2nd level: j (where j goes from 1 to i increasing) 

The function nested ranking here is used to prove termination: with `i` gradually decreasing from `array_size - 1` to 0 and inner loop variable `j` goes from 1 to `i`, ensuring that all iterations of the inner loop complete before `i` decreases further, leading to program termination.

1. Phase: (i+1) over the outer loop  
2. Phase: (i-j+1) over the inner loop  

The program will always terminate because the `bubbleSort` function consists of a nested loop. The outer loop iterates from `array_size - 1` down to 0, and the inner loop iterates from 1 to `i`. Both loops have bounds that decrease with each iteration, ensuring that the loops will eventually terminate. The use of a nondeterministically chosen `array_size` is managed by a check ensuring that it is at least 1, which is sufficient to guarantee well-defined behavior.
