[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
n - x  

The program will terminate because in each iteration of the loop, the value of `x` is increased by 1. Since `n` is constant, the condition `x < n` will eventually become false, causing the loop to terminate. The ranking function `n - x` decreases by 1 in every iteration, which proves termination.
