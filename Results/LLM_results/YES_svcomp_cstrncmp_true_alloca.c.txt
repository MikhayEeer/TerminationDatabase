[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * n^1 + 0.0 * 1

Explanation: In the loop `while (n-- > 0 && *s1 == *s2)`, the integer `n` is non‚Äênegative at entry and strictly decreases by 1 on each iteration, so the linear ranking function r(n)=n witnesses termination.
