[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
-1.0 * y^1 + 0.0 * 1  
-1.0 * z^1 + 0.0 * 1  

The program terminates because it uses a multi-phase ranking function where the first phase decreases `y` and moves away from the loop condition `x >= y`, eventually causing it to become false. The secondary phase ensures that the loop exits as `z` decreases to 1, preventing `x` from increasing indefinitely when `z` is greater than 1.
