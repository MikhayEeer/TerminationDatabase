TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
nested
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * x_ref^1 (when *x_ref > *y_ref)
1.0 * y_ref^1 (when *y_ref >= *x_ref)

The program is terminating as the nested ranking function demonstrates that there is a strict decrease by 1 in either `x_ref` or `y_ref` within their respective inner while loops, and both `x_ref` and `y_ref` are non-negative initially. As such, they will eventually reach zero, causing the loops to terminate.
