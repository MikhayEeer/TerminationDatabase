[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * x + 1.0 * y

This ranking function is defined on the states satisfying the outer‐loop guard (x>0 ∧ y>0).  In every atomic decrement of either *x_ref or *y_ref, the sum x+y decreases by exactly 1 and remains non‐negative; once x+y reaches 0 the guard fails and no further transitions are possible, proving termination.
