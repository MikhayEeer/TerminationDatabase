TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1st phase: 1.0 * y^1
2nd phase: 1.0 * z^1

Explanation: The program has a 2-phase termination. In the first phase, as long as `y` is non-negative, the while loop decreases `y` by 1, eventually reaching a negative value. When `y` becomes negative, the program moves to the second phase where it decreases `z` by 1 in each loop iteration. Since `z` is initialized to be non-negative and decreases without being reset to a higher value (which could only happen when `y >= 0`), it will eventually become negative, allowing the loop to terminate. The sequence of events assures termination through these two phases.
