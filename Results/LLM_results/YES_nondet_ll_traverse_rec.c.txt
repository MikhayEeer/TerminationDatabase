Phase 1 (in init_list): f₁(n) = 1.0·n + 0.0  
Phase 2 (in traverse): f₂(curr) = 1.0·length(curr) + 0.0  

where “n” is the argument to init_list, and length(curr) is the number of remaining list nodes from curr (a non‐negative integer that strictly decreases on each recursive call).

Phase 1 (init_list): 1.0 * n  
Phase 2 (traverse): 1.0 * length(curr)  

Explanation:  
– In init_list(n), the argument n is a non‐negative integer (guaranteed by the check in main) and decreases by 1 on each recursive call, so 1·n is a valid ranking function for that phase.  
– In traverse(curr), the remaining list length is a non‐negative integer that decreases by 1 on each recursive call, so 1·length(curr) is a valid ranking function for that phase.
