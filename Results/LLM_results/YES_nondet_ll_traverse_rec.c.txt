n - current list length

The program initializes a linked list with a length of `n` and then uses the `traverse` function to recursively traverse this list. The only recursion occurs in the `traverse` function, which is guaranteed to terminate because it works through the list's `next` nodes until it encounters a `NULL`, which marks the end of the list. The length of the current sublist decreases with each recursive call, serving as a linear ranking function based on the number of nodes left to traverse. Hence, the program is terminating.
