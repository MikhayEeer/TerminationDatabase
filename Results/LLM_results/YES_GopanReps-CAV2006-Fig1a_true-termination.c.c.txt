[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * y^1  (when x <= 50, y is increased)  
-1.0 * y^1 (when x > 50, y is decreased)  

The program is terminating as the value of y will eventually decrease to a negative value once x exceeds 50. This will cause the loop to exit. The multi-phase ranking function shows that within the while loop, y is incremented when x is less than or equal to 50, and decremented otherwise, which ensures termination as y decreases below 0.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
0.5 * x - 1 * y + 25.0 for phase 1 (x <= 50)
1.0 * x for phase 2 (x > 50)
