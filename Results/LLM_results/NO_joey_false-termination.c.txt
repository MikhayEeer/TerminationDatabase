[REASON]
The recursive function `rec` can enter an infinite loop for certain values of `x`, particularly when `x` is a large positive odd integer. The case `rec(--x)` will revert the increment done by `rec(++x)`, and as such, the program does not make progress and can continue indefinitely.

[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The recursive function `rec` may not terminate for some inputs because it can enter a cycle when `x` is odd. Incrementing `x` (with `++x`) followed by decrementing it (with `--x`) brings it back to the same state, causing possible infinite recursion for such values.
