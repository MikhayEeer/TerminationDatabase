[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The loop condition `x >= 0 || y >= 0` may not be altered by the loop body when `a = b + 1`. Specifically, the update rules `x = x + a - b - 1` and `y = y + b - a - 1` simplify to `x = x` and `y = y`, respectively, under this condition, meaning the values of `x` and `y` will not change. Hence, if the initial state satisfies the loop condition, it will continue holding indefinitely, leading to non-termination.
