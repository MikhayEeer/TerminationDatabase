[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * x^1 + 0.0 * y^1
0.5 * x^1 + 0.5 * y^1

Explanation: The program is terminating because in each iteration of the loop, the values of `x` and `y` decrease with respect to the provided multi-phase ranking functions, indicating progress towards the termination condition `x <= 0 || y <= 0`. The first phase indicates that `x` is strictly decreasing, and the second phase combines both variables `x` and `y`, also demonstrating a decrease.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
nested
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1. primary: x + 2*y
2. secondary: x
