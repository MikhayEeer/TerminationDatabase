In the function `f(int a, int b)`:
1. 5.0 * 1 + 1.0 * b^1 + 5.0 * 1 (Phase 1: b is decreasing)
2. 1.0 * 1 + 1.0 * a^1 + 1.0 * 1 (Phase 2: a is increasing, but Phase 1 dominates because b becomes 0 before a can grow indefinitely)

In the function `g(int c, int d)`:
1. 1.0 * 1 + 1.0 * c^1 + 1.0 * 1 (Phase 1: c is decreasing)

Explanation:
The program is terminating because the recursive calls in function `f` ensure that the parameter `b` is strictly decreasing and eventually reaches 0, at which point function `f` calls `g` with arguments `(a, 0)`. In function `g`, the parameter `c` is strictly decreasing until it hits 0, and then the function terminates. Therefore, for any non-negative initial values of `a` and `b`, the recursive calls will eventually terminate.

[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
nested  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1. In the context of function `f`:  
   - Decreases in `b` ensures termination for calls to `f`.

2. In the context of function `g`:  
   - Decreases in `c` ensures termination for calls to `g`.

The termination of the program can be established by considering the nested ranking functions separately for the recursive function calls. The argument `b` in function `f` continually decreases per recursive call, and similarly, the argument `c` in function `g` decreases to zero per recursive call. When `b` reaches zero, control moves to function `g` via the base case of `f`, which then terminates when `c` reaches zero. As both processes have well-founded decreases that eventually terminate, the entire program terminates.
