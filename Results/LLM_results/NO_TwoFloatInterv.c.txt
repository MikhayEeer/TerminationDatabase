[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
For any initial i with 12 ≤ i ≤ 19, each loop iteration does: i1 = i−1 (since i<20), then i2 = i1+1 = i (since i1>10), and no other change, so i remains constant and the loop never exits.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
For any initial i in 12..19: the first if makes i→i–1 (still >10), the second if then makes i→i+1 back to its original value, the third if does not apply, so i never changes and the loop runs forever.
