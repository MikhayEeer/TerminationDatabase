[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The loop `while (x > 0)` can go into a non-terminating state depending on the values of `x` and `y`. For example, if initially `x = 1` and `y >= 0`, the value of `x` will keep increasing because of the operation `x = x + x + y`, causing `x > 0` to always hold, and the loop will not terminate.
