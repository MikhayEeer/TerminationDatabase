=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program does not always terminate because, when x is initially positive and y is large enough negative, the value of x may increase indefinitely instead of decreasing towards termination, resulting in an infinite loop.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program enters an infinite loop if x is initially positive and y is non-positive and odd. In such cases, x increases exponentially while y decreases linearly, preventing the loop condition from becoming false.
