[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
For any initial x,y with x+y>1 the loop update xₙ₊₁=2xₙ+yₙ, yₙ₊₁=yₙ−1 yields the closed‐form
xₙ=(x₀+y₀−1)·2ⁿ + n +1−y₀. 
If x₀+y₀−1>0 this grows without bound, so xₙ>0 for all n and the loop never terminates.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
There is an infinite execution. E.g. with x₀=1, y₀=0 we get yₜ=−t and xₜ₊₁=2xₜ+yₜ = xₜ+1, so xₜ=t+1>0 for all t and the loop never exits.
