# Piece 1: applies when x>0 (i.e. loop‐entry states)
DISCRIMINATOR: 1.0 * x^1 + 0.0 * y^1 + 0.0 > 0  
RANKING FUNCTION: 0.0 * x^1 + 0.0 * y^1 + 1.0  

Explanation:
Under any non‐terminating (i.e. non‐break) iteration we have x>0 initially and then x′=y≤−old_y<0, so the discriminator x′>0 fails and no further decrease obligation remains. Thus the piecewise constant function f(x,y)=1 on x>0 strictly decreases to 0 (outside the discriminator) on every loop transition.
