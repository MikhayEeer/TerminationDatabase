[RANKING FUNCTION]  
f(x, y) = x  

The program terminates because the variable `x` in the loop condition `x > 0` is assigned the value of `y` in each iteration. When the loop exits (either due to `x <= 0` or entering the `if` branch to break), the value of `x` is non-positive, causing the loop to terminate. The while loop's progress measure is the `x` variable value itself, resulting in a linear ranking function `f(x, y) = x`, showing a decrease in iterations.
