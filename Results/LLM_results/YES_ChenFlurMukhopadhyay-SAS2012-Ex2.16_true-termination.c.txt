[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * x^1 when y < 0, otherwise undefined

Explanation: The program terminates based on the structure of the loop and the effect of the assignments within it. When `x > 0`, the loop enters, and `x` is assigned the value of `y`, and then `y` is decremented. If `y` is initially negative, `x` will be set to a non-positive value, exiting the loop immediately. Thus, the loop can only continue running if `y` is non-negative before the assignment, but `y` decreases with each iteration, eventually becoming negative and causing the loop to exit. This ensures termination in all cases.

[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * x^1 + 0.0 * 1  
1.0 * y^1 + 0.0 * 1  

Explanation:  
The program is terminating, and this can be illustrated with a multi-phase ranking function. Initially, `x` is assigned a value greater than 0. During each iteration of the loop, `x` is set to the current value of `y`, and `y` is decremented by 1. The ranking functions show that in each phase of execution, either `x` or `y` eventually decreases and will reach a point where the loop condition `x > 0` is no longer satisfied, thus proving termination.
