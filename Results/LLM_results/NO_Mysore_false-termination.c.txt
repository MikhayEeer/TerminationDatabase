=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
For c<0 and x≥−c, each loop iteration increases x+c by (−c−1)≥0, so once x+c≥0 the condition remains true forever, yielding an infinite loop.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
For any initial c<0 and x≥−c, each iteration does x→x−c and c→c−1, so the guard x+c≥0 remains true forever, yielding an infinite loop.
