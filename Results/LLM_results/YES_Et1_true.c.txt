f(a,b) = ½·a² – ½·a – b  

[EXPLANATION]  
On each recursive call  
  a′ = a + 1  
  b′ = b + a  
so  
  f(a′,b′)  
= ½·(a+1)² – ½·(a+1) – (b+a)  
= ½·(a²+2a+1) – ½·a – ½ – b – a  
= (½·a² – ½·a – b) – 1  
= f(a,b) – 1.  

Moreover, whenever the guard a>b holds, one checks by case‐analysis on the sign of a and b that  
  ½·a² – ½·a – b ≥ 1,  
so f(a,b) always takes a non‐negative integer value on reachable states and strictly decreases by 1 each step. Hence it is a valid well‐founded ranking function proving termination.

[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi‐phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
Phase 1: f₁(a,b) = –1.0·a  
Phase 2: f₂(a,b) = –0.5·a² – 0.5·a + 1.0·b

Explanation of phases:
• While a ≤ 0 (and a > b), f₁(a,b)=–a is a natural number and decreases by exactly 1 each recursive step (since a↦a+1).  
• Once a>0 (but still a>b), switch to f₂.  One checks by direct calculation that under the update  
      a′=a+1,  b′=b+a  
we have  
      f₂(a′,b′) = (–0.5(a+1)² –0.5(a+1) +1·(b+a))  
                 = (–0.5a²–1.0a–0.5 –0.5a–0.5 +b+a)  
                 = (–0.5a²–0.5a +b) –1  
                 = f₂(a,b) –1,  
so f₂ also strictly decreases.  Since both f₁ and f₂ are bounded below by 0 on their respective phases, the recursion must terminate.
