[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
max{x, 0} + max{y, 0}  

Explanation:  
The program is terminating, as it continuously decreases the values of `x` and `y` based on their initial conditions. The ranking function `max{x, 0} + max{y, 0}` shows that the sum of the non-negative parts of `x` and `y` strictly decreases with each iteration of the loop, ensuring termination.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
parallel
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
max{x, 0} + max{y, 0}

The program will terminate because, in every iteration of the loop, either `x` is nonnegative and is decremented by 1, or if `x` is negative, `y` is decremented by 1 if `y` is nonnegative. Hence, the value of the ranking function `max{x, 0} + max{y, 0}` decreases with every iteration, which proves termination using a parallel ranking function.
