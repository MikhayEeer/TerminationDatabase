max{1.0 * x^1, 0} + max{1.0 * y^1, 0}  

The program terminates because the combined size of x and y (considering non-negative values) decreases at every step: if x is non-negative, it decreases; if x is negative and y is non-negative, y decreases. When both are negative, the loop terminates.

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1. max{x, 0} + max{y, 0}  

The program is terminating. This can be proven by using a piecewise ranking function which is a combination of linear max functions. The function \( f(x, y) = \max\{x, 0\} + \max\{y, 0\} \) decreases with every iteration of the loop until it reaches zero, thus ensuring termination.
