[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1st phase:  
Derived from the outer loop:  
f(x, y) = x  

2nd phase (within the first inner while loop):  
Derived from the conditions y >= x + 1:  
f(y, x) = y - x  

3rd phase (within the second inner while loop):  
Derived from the conditions y >= x + 3:  
f(y, x) = y - (x + 3)  

The program is terminating and is proven by the use of a multi-phase ranking function.
