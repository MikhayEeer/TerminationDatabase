1.0 * y^1 + -1.0 * x^1 + -3.0 * 1  
1.0 * y^1 + -1.0 * x^1 + -1.0 * 1  
1.0 * x^1 + -2.0 * 1  

Explanation of phases:  
– Phase 1 (inner2): when y ≥ x + 3, f₁(y,x)=y–x–3 decreases by 3 each iteration.  
– Phase 2 (inner1): when y ≥ x + 1 but y < x + 3, f₂(y,x)=y–x–1 decreases to <0 in at most two steps.  
– Phase 3 (outer): when x ≥ 2, f₃(x)=x–2 decreases by at least 0 (actually by ≥2) each outer iteration, forcing x<2.

# Piece 1: when y ≥ x + 1
guard: y - x - 1 ≥ 0  
f₁(x,y) = y - x  
# In one outer‐loop iteration from this region f₁ drops from ≥1 to ≤0

# Piece 2: when y < x + 1
guard: y - x - 1 < 0  
f₂(x,y) = 2·x - y  
# Each outer‐loop iteration in this region decreases f₂ by at least 5
