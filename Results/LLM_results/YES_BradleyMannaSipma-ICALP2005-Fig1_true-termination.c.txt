Explanation of the ranking function:

• Let f₁(x,y) = N − x.  In each iteration, either the “else” branch executes and x increases by 1 (so f₁ decreases by 1), or the “if” branch executes and x increases by at least 0 (so f₁ does not increase).  
• If f₁ ever fails to decrease in an “if” step, that can only happen when x+y=0 (so y=−x), in which case y is incremented and hence f₂(x,y)=−y decreases by 1.  
• Once f₁ reaches 0, x>N and the loop exits.  
Thus (f₁,f₂) is a valid nested (lexicographic) ranking function proving termination.
