=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
piecewise
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * N - 1.0 * x + 0.0 * y^(1) when x + y >= 0 and x <= N
0.0 * 1 when x > N

The program is terminating because there is a piecewise ranking function. The ranking function decreases when \( x <= N \) and once \( x > N \), the loop exits. This ensures that the progress toward termination is well-defined and finite.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1st Phase:  
\( N - x \)  

2nd Phase:  
\( x^2 + x \)  

The program will terminate. Initially, the variable \(x\) is bounded above by \(N\) in the while loop, and each iteration either increments \(x\) or increases it at a faster rate by \(2x+y\), implying a linear decrease phase until \(x > N\). When \(x\) exceeds \(N\), the state and potential transitions ensure eventual cessation as \(x\) grows quadratically in the second phase, covering all possible cases to conclude termination.
