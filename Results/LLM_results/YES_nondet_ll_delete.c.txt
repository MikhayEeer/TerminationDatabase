[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1. The `init_list(int n)` function's loop:  
   - Ranking Function: \( n - j \) where `j` is the loop variable incrementing from 0 to `n-1`.  
   
2. The `delete(struct list** head_ptr, int m)` function's loop:  
   - Ranking Function: The number of items in the list for which the `value` is equal to `m` decrements with each iteration that successfully finds and deletes such a node, therefore establishing a piecewise linear ranking based on the count of nodes with value `m`.

The program consists of two main parts: list initialization and deletion. Each part has a well-defined termination condition. Initialization loop runs for a fixed number of steps (based on `n`), and the deletion loop reduces the length of the list with every removal of a targeted value, ensuring termination.
