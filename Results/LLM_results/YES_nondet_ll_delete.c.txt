[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
Length of the linked list

The program terminates because the `delete` function iterates over the linked list and only performs pointer reassignments to remove nodes with a specific value. The number of iterations is directly determined by the length of the list, which is finite. Once the operations are performed, the program returns from `delete` and subsequently from `main`, ensuring termination. The ranking function here corresponds to the remaining length of the list during the traversal in `delete`.

[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1. The `init_list` function loops with a ranking function on `n`, which strictly decreases until the loop exits after `n` iterations.
2. The `delete` function's `while` loop is bound by the number of elements in the list, which is finite and strictly decreases whenever an element is removed or retained without further action. Hence, the loop must eventually terminate.
