Phase 1 (init_list): R₁(j) = n – j  
 – At each iteration j increases by 1, so R₁ decreases by 1, and the loop exits when j = n.

Phase 2 (delete): R₂(curr) = |{ x : x is reachable from curr→next }|  
 – On each iteration either (a) curr→next is removed (so the number of reachable nodes decreases by 1) or (b) curr moves forward by one (so the remaining suffix starting at curr→next loses its old head and again decreases by 1). Hence R₂ strictly decreases to 0 and the loop terminates.
