[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTION]
i - j

The program is terminating because the value of the expression `i - j` decreases in every iteration of the loop. The value `i` decreases by a non-negative amount (`nondetNat`), and `j` increases by a positive amount (`nondetPos`). Thus, `i - j` continually decreases, and since the loop condition is `i - j >= 1`, this ensures the loop eventually terminates.
