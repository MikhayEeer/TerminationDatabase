[REASON]  
The update for `x` using `x = 10*y - 2*x` can result in repeated states if `x` and `y` are initialized such that `x = 10y/3`. For example, if `x=10k` and `y=3k` for any `k>0`, the value of `x` doesn't decrease, and the loop condition `x > 0 && y > 0` remains true indefinitely, causing an infinite loop.
