=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
There is a positive non‐trivial fixed point: if y=3k, x=10k (k>0) then x′=10·(3k)−2·(10k)=10k=x, y unchanged, so x>0,y>0 forever.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
For any k>0, choosing y=3k and x=10k gives x′=10·y−2·x=30k−20k=10k=x, so x stays positive and the loop never exits.
