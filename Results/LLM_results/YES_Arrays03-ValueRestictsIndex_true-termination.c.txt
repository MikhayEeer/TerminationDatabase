x

Explanation: The loops condition `while(x >= 0)` references the nondeterministic integer `x` and decreases `x` by the non-zero integer `k` (as `a[0] != a[k]` implies `k != 0`) in each iteration. Therefore, `x` is a linear ranking function that will eventually become negative due to continuous decrement by `k`. The terminating condition is that `x < 0`, at which point the loop will terminate.
