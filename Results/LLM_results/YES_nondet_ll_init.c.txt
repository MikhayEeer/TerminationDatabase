Integer value `n` which is non-negative

The function `init_list` is called with an integer `n` which is non-deterministically determined and the loop inside `init_list` runs for `n` iterations, since `j` increments sequentially until it equals `n`. The ranking function shows decreasing progress on each iteration step towards termination. Therefore, since all list construction operations terminate after `n` iterations, the program is terminating.

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
The program's control flow will always terminate because the `init_list` function will execute a finite number of iterations based on the integer `n`. Each iteration creates a new node in the list with `malloc`, links it through the `next` pointer, and assigns it as the `tail`. Since `j` goes from 0 to `n-1`, there is no infinite loop, and the function will terminate after `n` iterations. Hence, the program as a whole will terminate.
