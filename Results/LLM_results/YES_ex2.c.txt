=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
Mutual recursion between `rec1` and `rec2` can lead to non-termination as `rec1` may call itself with increasing values of `i`.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The mutual recursion between `rec1` and `rec2` leads to infinite recursion for certain inputs. Specifically, `rec1` calls itself with an incremented value in its recursion through `rec2`, causing non-termination when started with positive values.
