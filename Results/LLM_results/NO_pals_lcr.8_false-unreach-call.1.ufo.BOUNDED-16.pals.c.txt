[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
0.0625 * (16 - i2)  

The program has a clear termination condition as the loop controlled by `i2` runs a finite number of times (16 iterations), ensuring that the program will eventually terminate. The ranking function `16 - i2` monotonically decreases with each iteration of the loop, starting from 16 and going down to 0.
