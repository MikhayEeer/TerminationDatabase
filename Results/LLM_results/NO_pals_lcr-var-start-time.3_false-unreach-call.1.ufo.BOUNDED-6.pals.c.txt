TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
i2 (with bound 6)  

The termination is guaranteed because the loop explicitly iterates a fixed number of times, determined by `i2 < 6`, which serves as a bound for the loop's execution. The ranking function depends on the counter `i2`, which will eventually reach 6, causing the loop to terminate.
