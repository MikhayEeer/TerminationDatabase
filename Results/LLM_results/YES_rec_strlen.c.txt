R(p) = length1 − (p − nondetString1)

Explanation: On each recursive call we pass p+1, so R(p+1)=R(p)−1, and when *p=='\0' we have R(p)=0 and no further calls. Thus R is a non-negative integer that strictly decreases to 0.

[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * length1^1 + -1.0 * (p - nondetString1)^1

Explanation:
We view each recursive call of strlen_rec(p) as decreasing the quantity f(p) = length1 – (p – nondetString1) by exactly 1. Initially p = nondetString1 so f = length1 ≥ 1, and when p reaches the terminator at index length1–1 we have f = 1 and the next call returns without further recursion. Thus f is a linear ranking function proving termination.
