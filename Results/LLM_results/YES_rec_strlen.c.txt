strlen_rec(p): strlen_rec(p) decreases by 1 with each recursive call, and terminates when *p is '\0'.

linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
length1 - 1

The program terminates because the recursive function `strlen_rec` is called with a string that is guaranteed to have a null terminator in its last position. The value of the length of the string (denoted as `length1`) decreases as each recursive call processes a part of the string until it reaches the null character. The ranking function `length1 - 1` indicates that as `strlen_rec` is called recursively, the length of the unprocessed part of the string decreases linearly until termination.
