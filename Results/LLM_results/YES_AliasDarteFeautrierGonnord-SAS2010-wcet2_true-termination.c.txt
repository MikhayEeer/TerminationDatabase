Explanation:
This program contains a nested loop structure. The outer loop (`while (i < 5)`) ensures that the variable `i` is incremented in every iteration until it reaches 5, hence there are a finite number of iterations (up to `i=5`). In each iteration of the outer loop, `j` is reset to 0 and the inner loop (`while (i > 2 && j <= 9)`) increments `j` up to a maximum of 10 times, but also doesn't affect the continuation condition for `i`. The decrement in the ranking function for `i` and the limited increment for `j` adequately describe the finite and ordered sequence of program states leading to termination.
