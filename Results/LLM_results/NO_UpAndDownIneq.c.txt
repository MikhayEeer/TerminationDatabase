[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program is non-terminating because the variable `i` can oscillate indefinitely between values 0 and 10 without exiting the loop. When `i` reaches 0, `up` is set to 1, causing `i` to increment. When `i` reaches 10, `up` is set to 0, causing `i` to decrement. Thus, `i` can keep cycling between increasing and decreasing indefinitely when starting from any value in the range [0, 10].
