[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
For 0≤i≤10 the variable up flips at the bounds so i increments at 0 and decrements at 10, causing i to bounce indefinitely between 0 and 10.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
For any initial i in [0,10], up toggles direction at the boundaries and i endlessly bounces between 0 and 10, so the loop never exits.
