[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The loop is infinite due to its `while (true)` structure and there are no conditions or breaks that would make the loop terminate. The update of `i` does not change this behavior.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The loop is infinite since it executes indefinitely without any condition modifying the value of `i` in such a way that could exit the loop. The variable `i` is either decremented or incremented in each iteration with no termination condition breaking the loop.
