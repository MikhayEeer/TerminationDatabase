[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
If `z <= y`, then `f(x, y, z) = y - x`.  
If `z > y`, then `f(x, y, z) = -1` (program terminates immediately after the first iteration).

Explanation:  
The program contains a loop where the condition `x < y` is checked. In each iteration, `x` is incremented by 1, and `y` is assigned the value `z`. Since `z` is nondeterministically chosen, we consider two cases for the piecewise ranking function:

1. **Case 1 (`z <= y`)**: The ranking function `f(x, y, z) = y - x` is strictly decreasing in each iteration because `x` increments by 1 while `y` is reset to `z` which is not greater than its previous value `y`. Given `z <= y`, `y` cannot increase to make the loop condition `x < y` valid indefinitely, ensuring termination.

2. **Case 2 (`z > y`)**: The loop terminates immediately after the first iteration setting `y = z`, as `x` is incremented and the loop condition is not satisfied anymore. Here, a fixed ranking value like `-1` signifies termination. 

Therefore, the program is terminating.

[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The loop can continue indefinitely if x < y and x increments but y is reset to a constant value (z) in each iteration, preventing x from ever reaching or surpassing y.
