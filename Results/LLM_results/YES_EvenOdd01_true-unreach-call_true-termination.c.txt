[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
The program makes recursive calls decrements the integer `n` by 1 in each step, reducing its value towards 0. Since `n` is initialized with a non-negative value and strictly decreases with each function call, this guarantees termination. Thus, the ranking function is `n` itself, which is a linear function showcasing strictly decreasing behavior in the recursion.

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
n for each call of isOdd and isEven functions with n > 0

The program utilizes mutually recursive functions `isOdd` and `isEven` to determine whether a number is odd or even. The termination depends on the recursive call reducing the input `n` by 1 each time (`n - 1`), eventually reaching a base case of `n = 0` or `n = 1`. This ensures that each call reduces the problem size and will terminate given `n >= 0`. Thus, a nested ranking function based on the decreasing variable `n` is used to justify termination.
