1. First Level: \( x \) decreases with each iteration of the outer loop.
2. Second Level: \( x - y \) decreases with each iteration of the inner loop. 

The outer loop decreases the variable \( x \) until it becomes zero, while the inner loop increases \( y \) until it equals \( x \). Overall, each iteration of the inner loop decreases the difference \( x - y \) to zero. Once the inner loop finishes, \( x \) is decremented, eventually terminating the outer loop. Thus, the program terminates.
