[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The variable `d` can become 0 due to the first conditional branch (if `__VERIFIER_nondet_int()` returns true) and the decrement operation, which in turn makes `x` non-decreasing in the loop condition `while (x > 0)`. Therefore, if `x` is non-negative initially and less than `d`, the loop condition never becomes false, leading to non-termination.
