=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The loop decrements x by d, but d is set nondeterministically to 1, 0, or −1. If x>0 and d≤0 then x does not decrease (or even increases), so the while(x>0) loop can run forever.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The loop decrement d can be 0 or negative (via the two nondet branches), so x does not strictly decrease and can remain >0 indefinitely, yielding a non-terminating run.
