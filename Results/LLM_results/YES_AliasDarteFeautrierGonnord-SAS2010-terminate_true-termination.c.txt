[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * (100 - i) + 1.0 * 1
1.0 * (j - k) + 1.0 * 1

The program terminates because the value of `i` continuously increases toward 100, and the value of `k` decreases toward `j`. The loop condition (`i <= 100 && j <= k`) will eventually be false, leading to termination. The first phase ensures `i` approaches 100, and the second phase maintains `j <= k` where `k` decreases in each iteration until termination.
