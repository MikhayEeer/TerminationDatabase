[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The loop condition `min == y` remains true because if initially `x >= y`, `min` is set to `y`. Then, as `y` is incremented indefinitely in each iteration (`y = y + 1`), `x < y` eventually becomes true, setting `min` again to `x`. However, this does not exit the loop as `min` can be reassigned to `y` when `x >= y` again in some nondeterministic cases. Thus, the loop can continue forever depending on input values due to nondeterministic behavior.
