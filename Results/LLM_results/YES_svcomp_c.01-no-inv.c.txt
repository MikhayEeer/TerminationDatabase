Explanation:
- The outer loop is bounded by `x >= 0`, which decreases by 1 in each iteration (`x = x - 1`). Therefore, the value of `x` acts as a ranking function where its value decreases on each iteration of the outer loop.
- The inner loop, whose condition is governed by `x > y`, repeatedly doubles `y` until `y` exceeds `x`. The number of iterations of this inner loop is bounded as a function of `x` and follows a geometric growth pattern, hence it terminates before the outer loop decrements `x` again.
