1.0 * (x - y/2)^1    

The program terminates. The outer loop will descend monotonically as `x` is decremented in each iteration, and eventually `x` will become negative, causing the loop to terminate. The inner loop, for any fixed `x`, `y` is incremented geometrically and will exceed `x` in a finite number of steps, which makes `x > y` false, terminating the inner loop.
