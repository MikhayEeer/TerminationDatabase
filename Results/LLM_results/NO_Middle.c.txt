=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTION]
f(i, j) = i - j

This linear ranking function shows that with each iteration of the loop, the value of `i - j` is decreased. Since any integer sequence that strictly decreases and is bounded below must eventually terminate, we can conclude that the program terminates.
