[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
x - (y * (y - 1)) / 2

The program is terminating since the value of the expression `x - (y * (y - 1)) / 2` decreases with each iteration of the loop and is bounded from below. Initially, `y` is 1 and increases with each iteration, and `x` is decreased by `y`. The expression `x - (y * (y - 1)) / 2` reflects a linear combination of changes in `x` and `y`, showing that there is a linear decrease in the value until `x` becomes non-positive, at which point the loop terminates.
