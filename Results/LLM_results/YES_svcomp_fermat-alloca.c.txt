0.000001 * 1 + 1.0 *  -a^1 + 1.0 * MAX  

The program is terminating because it performs a bounded exploration of combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c`, where each variable has a finite limit (`MAX`). The outermost loop iterates over all combinations and eventually terminates when `c` exceeds `MAX`.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * MAX^3 + 1.0 * MAX^2 + b^1  
(MAX - b)^1 + 1.0 * c^1 + (MAX - a)^1  

Explanation:  
The program iterates through all possible combinations of (a, b, c) triplet values constrained by MAX, searching for a solution to the condition `a^3 = b^3 + c^3`. If no such triplet is found, the loops terminate when counter `c` exceeds MAX. The multi-phase ranking function decreases as we exhaust all b's for a given c, and eventually move to the next c, guaranteeing termination.
