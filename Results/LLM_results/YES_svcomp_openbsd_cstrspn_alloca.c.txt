=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * length1 + 1.0 * 1.0 – 1.0 * (p – s1)

Explanation: In the loop labeled “cont” each time we jump back p advances by 1, so f = length1+1–(p–s1) is always non-negative on entry and decreases by exactly 1 on every iteration, hence the loop must terminate.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0*length1 + -1.0*(p - s1)

This ranking function measures the remaining distance from p to the end of the string (length1), decreases by exactly 1 on each iteration of the loop in cstrspn, and is bounded below by 0, proving termination.
