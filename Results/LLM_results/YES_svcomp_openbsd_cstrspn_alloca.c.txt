length1 - (p - s1)  

The function `cstrspn` iterates over the characters in `s1`, stopping when it finds a character not present in `s2`. The string `s1` is guaranteed to terminate with a null character, ensuring that the loop will always terminate. Specifically, the pointer `p` traverses `s1` and moves forward one character at a time, and since `s1` is null-terminated, the difference `p - s1` increases until `p` points to the null character. Thus, the length of the substring still to be considered, `length1 - (p - s1)`, is a linear ranking function that decreases with every iteration of the loop.

length1 - (p - s1)  

Explanation: The function `cstrspn` iterates through the string `s1` to find characters not present in `s2` or until it encounters the null terminator. The loop is bounded by `length1`, which implies that the function will always eventually terminate as `p` progresses through the string `s1` ensuring that `(p - s1)` is strictly increasing up to `length1-1`. Since the loop cannot progress beyond the end of `s1`, the ranking function `length1 - (p - s1)` will eventually reach zero, thereby proving termination.
