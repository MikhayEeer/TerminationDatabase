death - life 

Explanation: In the given program, the loop condition is `life < death`, and within the loop, `death` is assigned the value of `life + 1`, and `life` is assigned the initial value of `death`, which effectively ensures that `death - life` reduces by at least 1 during each iteration of the loop (as long as the loop condition holds). The loop eventually terminates when `life` is no longer less than `death`, making the program terminating.
