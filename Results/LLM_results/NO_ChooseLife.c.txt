17 - life 

The given program terminates because the loop condition `life < death` is eventually falsified due to the specific way `life` and `death` are updated during each iteration. Initially, `death` is greater than `life` (17 > 13). In every iteration of the loop, `life` is set to the previous value of `death`, and `death` is set to `life + 1`. The subtraction decreases in each step, ensuring `life` eventually becomes equal to or greater than `death`, consequently terminating the loop. The linear ranking function `17 - life` decreases in every iteration, proving termination.
