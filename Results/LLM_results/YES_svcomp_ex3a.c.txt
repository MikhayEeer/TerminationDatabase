[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
Piecewise function based on condition:  
1. If x <= 1 or x >= 100, the loop does not execute, so the function trivially terminates.  
2. If 1 < x < 100, x becomes x*x in each iteration. Since x is an integer and x >= 10 results in x*x >= 100 (which exits the loop), the loop will terminate in a finite number of steps.  

Thus, a ranking function is constructed based on the behavior of x such that it exponentially increases and exits the loop.
