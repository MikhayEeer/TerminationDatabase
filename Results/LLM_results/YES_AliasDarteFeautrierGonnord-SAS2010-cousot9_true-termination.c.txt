nested  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * i^1 + 1.0 * 1  
0.1 * j^1 + 1.0 * 1  

The program is terminating since it uses a nested ranking function. The outer ranking function is a linear function of `i` that decreases every time `j` reaches zero and resets to `N`, while `i` is decremented. The inner ranking function decreases with `j` decrementing until it reaches zero. This ensures that every path through the loop results in progress towards termination.
