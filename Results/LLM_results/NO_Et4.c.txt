=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The nondeterministic r can always be –1, so c stays constant, b is reset to 10, and (b–c≥1 && a==c) remains true, yielding an infinite loop.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
By choosing r = –1 every iteration, we have c ← c + 1 + (–1) = c, a ← c, b = 10, so (b–c ≥ 1 && a == c) remains true forever, yielding an infinite loop.
