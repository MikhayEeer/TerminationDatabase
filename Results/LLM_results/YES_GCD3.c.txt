=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The loop manipulates the values of `x` and `y` in such a way that, for certain initial values, the condition `y > 0 && x > 0` can be preserved indefinitely. For example, if initially `x = y` and `y > 0`, each iteration of the outer loop will set `x` to the previous value of `y` and `y` to 0, causing the loop to continue indefinitely. Thus, the program does not guarantee termination for all input values.
