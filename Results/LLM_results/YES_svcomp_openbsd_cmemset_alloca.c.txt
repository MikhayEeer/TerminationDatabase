n

The program terminates. The loop inside the `cmemset` function will iterate `n` times, decreasing `n` by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. Since `n` is guaranteed to be a positive integer (greater than or equal to 1), the loop will eventually terminate, making the program overall terminating.

n

The function `cmemset` will terminate because the loop within this function is decrementing the value of `n` in each iteration, and the loop continues as long as `n` is not zero. Since `n` is initially set to a positive integer (at least 1), it will eventually decrease to zero, causing the loop to terminate. This establishes a linear ranking function in terms of `n`, demonstrating that the program will terminate.
