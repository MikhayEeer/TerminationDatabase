=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
When x+y>1 the loop update yields xₙ = 2ⁿ·(x₀+y₀−1)+(n+1−y₀) which stays >0 for all n, so the while(x>0) never exits.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
If x>0 and x+y>1 then each iteration x′=2x+y>x, so x stays positive forever and the while‐loop never exits.
