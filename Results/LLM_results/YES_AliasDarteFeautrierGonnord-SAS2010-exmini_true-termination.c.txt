The provided program is terminating. It contains a loop with a pair of phase decreasing criteria:
1. The first ranking function \(100 - i\) shows that as long as the loop continues, `i` keeps increasing (since `i` begins as a non-deterministic integer but is pivoted between the values of `i` and `j`), moving closer to or exceeding 100, which over time decreases the value of the function towards termination.
2. The second ranking function \(k - j\) depicts that with each iteration, `j` increases and `k` decreases, reducing the overall difference \(k - j\). Once the difference adjusts beyond non-positive values, the condition `j <= k` ceases to be true.

This multi-phase analysis shows how the combinations of variables evolve toward terminating the loop.
