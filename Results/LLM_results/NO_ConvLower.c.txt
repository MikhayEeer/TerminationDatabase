[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
i - 5  

The program is terminating because, within the while loop, the variable `i` is decremented by 1 in every iteration when `i != 10`. Since `i` starts as a nondeterministic integer greater than 5 and cannot increase within the loop, it will eventually become 6, 7, 8, or 9, which will lead it to eventually reach 5 or less, causing the loop to end. The linear ranking function `i - 5` decreases with each iteration of the loop ensuring termination.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The loop condition `i > 5` allows `i` to remain greater than 5 indefinitely since the statement `i = i-1` is bypassed when `i == 10`, causing the program to halt progression, and thus potentially not terminating.
