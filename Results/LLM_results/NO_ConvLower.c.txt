NONTERM
[REASON]
If i starts at 10 (or any value â‰¥10), the loop decrements until i==10, then i!=10 is false so i stays 10 and the while(i>5) loop never terminates.

[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
If i==10 (or i>10 eventually decrements to 10), then in the loop i>5 holds but i!=10 is false, so i never changes and the loop never terminates.
