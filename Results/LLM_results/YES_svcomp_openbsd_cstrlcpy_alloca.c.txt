[RESULT]
TERMINATE

multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
Phase 1: 1.0 * n  
Phase 2: 1.0 * (length - (s - src))

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * n  
1.0 * length + -1.0 * (s - src)  

Explanation:  
– Phase 1: the copy‐loop “while (--n != 0)” is ranked by n, which strictly decreases to 0.  
– Phase 2: if that loop fell through (n==0), the tail‐scan “while (*s++)” is ranked by the remaining distance to the terminator, i.e. length – (s–src), which decreases to 0.
