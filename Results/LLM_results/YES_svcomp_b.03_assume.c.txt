1.0 * x + -1.0 * y

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * x^1 + -1.0 * y^1 + 0.0 * 1

Explanation: In the loop `while(x>y)`, the value f(x,y)=xâˆ’y is always positive when entering and decreases by exactly x>0 on each iteration, hence it is a valid linear ranking function proving termination.
