=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * x + 0.0 * tmp + 0.0

Explanation:
When the loop guard (x>0 && x==2*tmp) holds, x is decremented by 1 each iteration, so the function f(x,tmp)=x strictly decreases and is bounded below by 0. Hence the loop (and program) terminates.
