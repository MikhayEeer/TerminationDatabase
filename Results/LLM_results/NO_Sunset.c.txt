f(i) = i - 10  

The program is terminating because regardless of the initial value of `i`, the value decreases in each loop iteration when `i > 10` and eventually will become less than or equal to 10, causing the loop to terminate. The linear ranking function `f(i) = i - 10` is a measure of progress towards loop termination as it strictly decreases in each iteration of the loop.
