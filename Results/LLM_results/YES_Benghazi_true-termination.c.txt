[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * x^1

This program terminates because it decreases the value of `x` in every iteration of the loop by at least `d1`, which is initially set to 73. Since `d1` and `d2` are always positive (greater than or equal to 1), the loop will eventually cause `x` to become negative, at which point the loop will terminate. The phase switch between `d1` and `d2` ensures that `d1` continues to increment, maintaining decrease in `x`. Thus, we have a simple ranking function `f(x) = x`, which demonstrates termination.

[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1st phase: f(x,d1,d2) = x  
2nd phase: f(d1,d2) = d1 + d2, decreasing because d1 and d2 are constantly increasing while x decreases until negative.  

The program terminates because the value of `x` decreases in each iteration until it becomes negative, causing the loop to exit. The first phase ensures this decrease, while the second phase maintains the condition by adjusting `d1` and `d2`, but does not prevent termination.
