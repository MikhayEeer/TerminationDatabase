rec1(n>0) always returns 1, so for j=1 rec2(1) calls rec2(rec1(2))−1 = rec2(1)−1 with no change in argument, causing infinite recursion.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
For any j>0, rec1(j+1)=1, so rec2(j) calls rec2(1). But rec2(1)=rec2(1)−1, leading to an infinite self‐call with argument 1 and no decrease.
