[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
Main loop: 1.0 * x^1
Inner loop: 1.0 * xtmp^1

Explanation: The program is nested with two loops, an outer and an inner loop. The outer loop decreases the variable x until it is no longer greater than 1, and the inner loop decreases xtmp until it is no longer greater than 1. Both x and xtmp are guaranteed to eventually decrease to values that will terminate their respective loops, demonstrating the program's overall termination.
