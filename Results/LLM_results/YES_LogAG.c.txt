[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * x^1
0.5 * xtmp^1

The program is terminating and can be proved by the multi-phase ranking function. The outer loop decreases `x` by a constant factor in each iteration, while the inner loop decreases `xtmp` until it is no longer greater than 1, eventually terminating as well. Both loops make progress towards terminating conditions, with the nested structure being captured by the multi-phase ranking functions for `x` and `xtmp`.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
nested
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1st loop: x
2nd loop: xtmp

Explanation: The outer loop decreases the value of `x` every time it executes by reducing it by 2 and then incrementing `xtmp` by 1. The inner loop decreases `xtmp` by 2 on each iteration. Both `x` and `xtmp`, which are decremented, eventually fall below their respective loop continuation conditions (`x > 1` and `xtmp > 1`), ensuring termination.
