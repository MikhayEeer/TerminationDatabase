=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The loop condition `i < 100` never changes because `i` is updated as `i = i + 0`, resulting in an infinite loop.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The variable `i` is never incremented or decremented within the loop, causing an infinite loop as the loop condition `i < 100` will always remain true.
