[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * y_ref^1  
1.0 * x_ref^1  

The program terminates because the inner loop decreases the value of `y_ref` through `*y_ref = *y_ref - 1` until `*y_ref <= *z_ref`, ensuring that it will eventually exit. The outer loop likewise decreases `x_ref` through `*x_ref = *x_ref - 1` independently of the inner loop. Since both `x_ref` and `y_ref` are bounded below by `z_ref`, and both are strictly decreasing during their respective loops, the process will terminate. The ranking function is multi-phase because it follows two phases of reduction: first `y_ref` and then `x_ref`.
