This program is terminating. The nested structure of the loops allows for the derivation of a nested ranking function. In the outer loop, the variable `x_ref` decreases with each iteration until it's no longer greater than `z_ref`. Within the inner loop, the variable `y_ref` decreases until it is no longer greater than `z_ref`. Each of these loops reduces its respective variable monotonically, which ensures termination.
