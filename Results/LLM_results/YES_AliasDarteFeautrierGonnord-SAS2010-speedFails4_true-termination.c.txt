[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The loop condition `x <= n` might not be impacted properly due to non-deterministic initial conditions and updates, which do not guarantee that `x` will eventually exceed `n`. Specifically, if `t = 1` and `x` starts less than `n`, the loop may repeat indefinitely without changing `x`, preventing termination.
