=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
Both a and b are multiplied by constants >1 each iteration, so once a>=1 and b>=1 the loop guard remains true forever.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
If a≥1 and b≥1 initially, each iteration multiplies a and b by 2 and 3 respectively, so they never drop below 1 and the loop runs forever.
