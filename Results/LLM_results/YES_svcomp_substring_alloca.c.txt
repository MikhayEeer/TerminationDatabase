=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
nested
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * length1^1 + -1.0 * (ps - s)^1
1.0 * length2^1 + -1.0 * (pt - t)^1

Explanation:
– The outer loop “while (*ps != '\0')” is ranked by φ₁ = length1 – (ps–s), which decreases by 1 on each iteration and is always non‐negative.  
– The inner loop “while (*pt!='\0' && *pt==*ps2)” is ranked by φ₂ = length2 – (pt–t), which decreases by 1 on each character match and is bounded below by 0.  
Together these form a valid nested (lexicographic) ranking function proving termination.
