=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
Since r is unbounded, the adversary can choose r = -2 each iteration, giving aₙ₊₁ = aₙ - 1 - (-2) = aₙ + 1 so a (and thus b) stays > 0 forever, yielding an infinite loop.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The nondeterministic r can be chosen arbitrarily negative, causing a and b to grow without bound so that b>0 always holds and the loop may never terminate.
