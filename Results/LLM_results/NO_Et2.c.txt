=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The variables `a` and `b` can both remain positive or become positive indefinitely due to the influence of the nondeterministic variable `r` which can be assigned such values that prevent `b` from reaching a non-positive state. This can result in an infinite loop where `b` never becomes non-positive to exit the loop, thus the program is non-terminating.
