[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * x^1 + 0.0 * 1
1.0 * y^1 + 0.0 * 1

The program is terminating because it has the following properties:
- In the first phase, whenever `random < 42`, the value of `x` is decreased by 1, and although `y` is assigned a nondeterministic value, `x` is consistently reduced until it is no longer positive.
- In the second phase, when `random >= 42`, `y` is decreased by 1, moving towards termination.

The combination of both phases ensures that the loop will eventually terminate as both `x` and `y` decrease over time, leading to the condition `x > 0 && y > 0` eventually becoming false. Thus, a multi-phase ranking function is suitable to show termination.
