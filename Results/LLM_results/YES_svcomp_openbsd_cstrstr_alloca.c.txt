[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * n  
1.0 * (length1 − (s − base1))

Explanation of the two components (lexicographic order):
• Inner‐loop rank n is the remaining bound in cstrncmp and strictly decreases each character comparison.  
• Outer‐loop rank length1−(s−base1) is the number of characters left to scan in the haystack (nondetString1); each time the inner loop finishes without a match, s has advanced at least one position, so this second component strictly decreases.

multi‐phase  

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1) f₁ = length2 − i₁  
 – phase: cstrlen  
 – i₁ = current index into the “find” string (0 ≤ i₁ ≤ length2−1)  
 → each loop iteration in cstrlen increments i₁ by 1, so f₁ decreases by 1 and bottoms out at 0.  

2) f₂ = (length1 − i₂)·length2 + (length2−1 − i₃)  
 – phase: cstrstr / cstrncmp  
 – i₂ = current index in s (0 ≤ i₂ ≤ length1−1)  
 – i₃ = current index in the character‐by‐character compare (0 ≤ i₃ ≤ length2−1)  
 → each step of either the scan loop (advancing i₂) or the compare loop (advancing i₃) decreases f₂ by at least 1; when a compare fails you reset i₃ and advance i₂, still decreasing f₂ lexicographically, and when i₂ or i₃ reach their bounds you exit.  

Both f₁ and f₂ are natural‐valued and strictly decrease on each loop iteration, proving that all loops terminate.
