[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
When range reaches 0 and i is 0, the loop guard 0 ≤ i ≤ range holds but the body’s if-condition skips both updates, so execution stutters forever.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
When i and range reach 0 (a reachable state), the loop guard (0 ≤ i ≤ range) remains true but neither branch updates any variable, causing an infinite loop.
