nested
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1st level: range - i
2nd level: range

The program terminates because the value of `range` decreases once `i` reaches `range`, ensuring eventual termination. Specifically, the nested ranking function demonstrates that the program makes progress towards termination by decreasing either `range - i` while `i` iterates towards `range`, or decreasing `range` while resetting `i`.
