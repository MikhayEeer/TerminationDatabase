nested
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
The recursion in the function `id` has a ranking function using `x` that decreases by 1 with each recursive call until reaching 0, and since `x` is initially 10 and strictly decreases, the function eventually reaches the base case at `x == 0`. Hence, the recursion terminates.
