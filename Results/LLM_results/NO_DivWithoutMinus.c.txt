1.0 * z^1 + 0.0 * 1
0.0 * x^1 + 1.0 * y^1 + 0.0 * 1

Explanation: This program can be analyzed using a multi-phase ranking function approach. In the first phase, we focus on the variable `z`, which is initially set to `y` and decreases in each iteration if the loop is active. The program runs the loop while `z > 0` and the condition `(y == 0 || y > 0 && x > 0)` holds true. In the second phase, once the condition `y == 0` is encountered, the ranking function can focus on `y` which decreases in each step of the loop by being replenished to `z` or decremented. Each stage of execution has a clearly defined descending ranking function, indicting the eventual termination of the loop.

[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The conditions allow for an infinite execution: if \( x \) and \( y \) both start positive, and \( z \) is positive, the loop can continue indefinitely. When \( y \) reaches 0, it is reset back to \( z \) (which remains positive), and \( x \) keeps incrementing, allowing the cycle to repeat infinitely.
