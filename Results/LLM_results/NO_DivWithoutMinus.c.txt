=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
If initially x>0 and y>0 (so z>0), then y cycles from z down to 0 and is reset to z forever, x only increases, and the loop condition (z>0 and (y==0 or (y>0 and x>0))) remains true indefinitely, so the loop never terminates.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
If initial x>0 and y>0 (so z>0), each iteration decreases y to 0 then resets y to z and increments x, so the loop guard (z>0 ∧ y>0 ∧ x>0) stays true forever.
