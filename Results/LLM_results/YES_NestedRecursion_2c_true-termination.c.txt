=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The function `g(int x)` contains nested recursive calls that can lead to infinite recursion for certain inputs. Since the function depends on the result of another call to `g`, calculating a direct ranking function is not straightforward. Additionally, no definite base case termination guarantee ensures that the recursion will stop for all non-negative inputs, making the program non-terminating in some scenarios.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
nested  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
The program employs a nested recursion in the function `g` which decreases the argument `x` in each recursive call. The recursion unfolds such that the outer call `g(x)` eventually reduces `x` to 0 through multiple recursive layers, each decreasing `x` by 1 until reaching the base case. Hence, the termination can be argued by the eventual reduction of `x` to zero through the nested calls.
