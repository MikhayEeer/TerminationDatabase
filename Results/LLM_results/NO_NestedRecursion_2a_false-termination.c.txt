The program uses a nested recursive function `g(x)`, which is guaranteed to terminate. The function's recursive calls proceed by decreasing `x` towards 0, at which point the base case is reached, ensuring termination.

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
The function `g(int x)` is terminating due to the recursive calls decreasing the value of `x` until it reaches 0. The ranking function here is based on the nested nature of the recursive calls that reduce the argument step by step until a base case is reached:
- Outer call: Decrease `x` to `x - 1`.
- Inner call: Reduce the problem recursively with the same decremental logic until reaching the base case (`x == 0`).

The recursion will always eventually hit the base case where `x == 0`, ensuring termination.
