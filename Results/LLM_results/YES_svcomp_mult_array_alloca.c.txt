1.0 * 1 + 1.0 * (length*fac - j)^1 + 0.0 * 1  

Explanation:  
The program consists of two for-loops. The first loop iterates from 0 to `length-1`, and the second loop iterates from 0 to `length*fac-1`. Both loops have a clear decreasing counter (`length-i` for the first loop, `length*fac-j` for the second loop), which shows that the loops will eventually terminate. These linear functions act as the ranking functions for the respective loops, demonstrating that the overall program will terminate.

[RANKING FUNCTION]
length*fac - j

The program has a for-loop that iterates with `j` as the loop counter from 0 to `length*fac - 1`, which is finitely bounded by the product of `length` and `fac`. Given that both `length` and `fac` are initialized to at least 1, the loop will reach its termination condition (i.e., `j < length*fac` becomes false). The ranking function `length*fac - j` is a linear function of `j` that strictly decreases with every iteration, proving termination.
