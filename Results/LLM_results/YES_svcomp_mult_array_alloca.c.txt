1.0 * (length^1) + 0.0 * 1
1.0 * (length*fac^1) + 0.0 * 1

Explanation: 

The program contains two loops. The first loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < length`, and the second loop runs from `j = 0` to `j < length*fac`. Both these loops have fixed bounds defined by non-negative values (`length` and `fac`), which are determined before entering the loops. Therefore, these loops will iterate a fixed, finite number of times, guaranteeing termination.

The ranking functions for the loops are based on the loop counter `i` which decreases in the first loop and `j` which decreases in the second loop, until they reach their bounds (`length` and `length*fac`, respectively). This decreasing ordering shows that the program steps towards termination.
