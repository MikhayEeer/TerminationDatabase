[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
The function can be shown to terminate because the loops within the `lis` function have definite bounds. The outer loops iterate from 0 to N, where N is the size of the input array. Since N is determined by the `array_size`, which is positive, the loops have a finite number of iterations. Therefore, the function terminates, as each loop has a clear termination condition defined by the range of indices it iterates over.
