=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
none
[REASON]
The program terminates because:
1. The 'array_size' is ensured to be at least 1, hence the 'alloca' calls for 'best' and 'prev' are valid.
2. The nested loops (the 'lis' function) have a fixed upper bound determined by 'N', which is a positive integer.
3. There are no unbounded or infinite loops present.
Therefore, no ranking function is necessary.
