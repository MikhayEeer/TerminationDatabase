Outer loop: x
Inner loop: x - y

The outer loop condition `x >= 0` ensures that upon each execution, the variable `x` is decremented, making progress towards termination. The inner loop condition `x > y` doubles `y` and will always terminate once `y` becomes greater than or equal to `x`. Therefore, the combination of these nested loops forms a ranking function that guarantees the program is terminating.
