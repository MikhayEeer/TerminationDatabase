Phase 1: Decrease in the first argument until `m <= 0`. The function calls `a(m - 1, 1)` or `a(m - 1, ...)`, ensuring `m` eventually decreases and reaches a base case.  
Phase 2: Imposed by the recursive call structure. In the recursive call `a(m - 1, a(m, n - 1))`, the inner call to `a(m, n - 1)` ensures `n` decreases until `n <= 0`, which guarantees a transition to Phase 1.

The function `a(m, n)` can be shown to terminate using the concept of lexicographic ordering based on two arguments, `m` and `n`. The steps follow:

- There are two base cases where termination is explicit:
  1. If `m <= 0`, the function returns `n + 1`, which is a base case termination.
  2. If `n <= 0`, the function calls `a(m-1, 1)`, and since the first argument `m` decreases, we can confirm termination by moving towards the base case when `m` becomes non-positive.
  
- For the recursive call `a(m - 1, a(m, n - 1))`, notice that:
  - The first argument of the outer `a()` call, `m - 1`, is strictly decreasing.
  - The recursive call `a(m, n - 1)` in the second argument ensures that the second argument will decrease until it reaches a base case or until `m` further decreases due to the recursive structure.

Therefore, a nested ranking function involving the lexicographic tuple `(m, n)` can be established such that:
1. Decrease in `m` is a larger step that ensures eventual termination.
2. `n` decreases as long as `m` remains constant.

This reasoning applies for all `m, n` greater than or equal to zero as constrained by the pre-condition `if ( m >= 0 && n >= 0)`. Thus, each recursive call progresses towards termination.
