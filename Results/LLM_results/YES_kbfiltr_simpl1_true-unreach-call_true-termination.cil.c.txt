Explanation: The program’s control flow contains no unbounded loops or unbounded recursion. Every function call returns after a finite (and statically bounded) sequence of steps, so the overall execution must terminate. The constant ranking function f(s)=1 (for every state s) is trivially well‐founded since there are no transitions that form an infinite descending chain.
