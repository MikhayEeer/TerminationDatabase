# Phase 1: inner‐loop progress
   f₁(s, s2) = |s2| – (s – s2)
# Phase 2: outer‐loop progress
   f₂(sc1, s1) = |s1| – (sc1 – s1)

Explanation:
– |s2| is the (fixed) length of the second string; s – s2 is the current inner‐loop index.  Each inner‐loop iteration decreases f₁ by 1 and when f₁=0 the inner loop exits.  
– |s1| is the (fixed) length of the first string; sc1 – s1 is the current outer‐loop index.  Each completed inner loop (at f₁=0) advances sc1 and decreases f₂ by at least 1.  
Both f₁ and f₂ are non‐negative and strictly decrease in their respective loops, proving termination.

f₁ = length(s1) – (sc1 – s1)  
f₂ = length(s2) – (s – s2)  

Explanation:  
– The outer loop index i = sc1–s1 starts at 0 and increases up to length(s1), so f₁>0 and strictly decreases when the outer loop advances.  
– The inner loop index j = s–s2 starts at 0 and increases up to length(s2), so f₂>0 and strictly decreases on each inner‐loop iteration.  
Together (f₁,f₂) form a lexicographic (nested) ranking function proving termination.
