linear
[RANKING FUNCTION]
length(s1) - (sc1 - s1)

This program will terminate because the `cstrspn` function iterates through the characters of the first string `s1`. In each iteration of the outer loop, the pointer `sc1` advances through `s1` until it hits a null-terminating character or finds a match within `s2`. The ranking function identified shows that the number of remaining characters in `s1` decreases in each iteration, leading to eventual termination.

multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1. The length of `s1` is finite due to null termination; this ensures that the outer loop (for `sc1`) is iterated a finite number of times.
2. The string `s2` is also null-terminated, so the inner loop (for `s`) has a finite number of iterations each time.
3. Each iteration either results in returning from the function or incrementing `sc1` until it reaches the end of `s1`.
