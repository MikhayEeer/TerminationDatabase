=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The variable `x` is initialized to a non-deterministic value and is continuously incremented in the loop, which will never allow `x` to become negative, causing the program to loop indefinitely.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The variable `x` is incremented indefinitely within the loop, and there is no condition to break or exit the loop. Hence, the program enters an infinite loop for non-negative initial values of `x`.
