1.0 * length1 + -1.0 * s + 1.0 * str + -1.0

Explanation: In the loop of cstrlen, let s be the pointer walking from str up to str+(length1–1). The function f = length1 – (s–str) – 1 is initially ≥0, strictly decreases by 1 each iteration, and when it reaches 0 the loop exits. Hence the program terminates.
