[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
There exists a feasible infinite run: e.g. starting with x=1, y=0 (which satisfies x+y≥0), the loop update x:=2x+y, y:=y+1 makes x grow (1→2→5→12→…), so x stays >0 forever and the loop never terminates.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
For example, with x=1, y=0 (so x+y≥0) each step does x←2x+y, y←y+1, giving x_{n+1}=2x_n+n and x_n>0 for all n, so the loop never exits.
