[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program is non-terminating because if the initial value of `x` is positive and `x + y` is non-negative, then in each iteration of the loop, `x` is increased by `x + y`, which is always positive. This causes `x` to increase indefinitely, keeping the loop condition `x > 0` true forever.
