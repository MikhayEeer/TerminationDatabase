This program is guaranteed to terminate because: 

1. The outer loop `while (i < n)` contains incrementing steps for `i`, leading to termination when `i` reaches `n`.
2. The middle loop `while (j < m)` increments `j` in each iteration, terminating when `j` reaches `m`.
3. The innermost loop `while (k < N)` increments `k` in each iteration until `k` reaches `N`.

The combination of these loops results in two well-defined phases of execution. The ranking functions provided reflect the decrease in the variant of each loop until termination conditions are met.

[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
Phase 1: 3.0 * N - k  
Phase 2: 1.0 * m - j  
Phase 3: 1.0 * n - i  

Explanation: The program features a sequence of nested loops that correspond to different phases in execution. 

- The innermost loop increments `k` until it reaches `N`, which ensures termination for every iteration as `N - k` decreases with each iteration.
- The middle loop increments `j` until it reaches `m`. Every complete execution of the innermost loop results in `j` decreasing the distance to `m`, thus leading to eventual termination.
- The outermost loop increments `i` until it reaches `n`. Similarly, every completion of the middle loop results in `i` closing in on `n`, leading to termination.

These ranking functions decrease across their respective phases, demonstrating overall termination of the program.
