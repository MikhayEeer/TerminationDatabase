Explanation:  
The program consists of three nested loops. The outermost loop runs while `i < n`, the middle loop runs while `j < m`, and the innermost loop is a self-contained loop running while `k < N`. Each loop reduces some measure monotonically: 

1. The top-level loop variable `i` increases up to `n`.
2. At the next level, within the `i` loop, `j` increases up to `m`.
3. At the innermost level, within the `k` loop, `k` increases up to `N`.

These act as ranking functions demonstrating a reduction to termination for each corresponding loop phase. As each loop moves consistently in a positive direction towards its respective bound and all involved variables (n, m, N) are non-negative, the program is guaranteed to eventually terminate.

Phase 1:  
1.0 * (n - i) + 0.0 * 1  
Phase 2:  
1.0 * (m - j) + 0.0 * 1  
Phase 3:  
1.0 * (N - k) + 0.0 * 1  

This program is terminating. The phases correspond to the loop nesting levels:   
- Phase 1 corresponds to the outermost loop with variable `i`, terminating as `i` reaches `n`.  
- Phase 2 corresponds to the middle loop with variable `j`, which increments up to `m`.  
- Phase 3 handles the innermost loop with variable `k`, proceeding until `k` reaches `N`.  
Each phase decreases monotonically and eventually results in the termination of its corresponding loop due to the bounded non-negative conditions on `n`, `m`, and `N`.
