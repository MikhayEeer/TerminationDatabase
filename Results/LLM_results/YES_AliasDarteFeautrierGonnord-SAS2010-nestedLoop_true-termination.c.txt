[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * N + -1.0 * k
1.0 * m + -1.0 * j
1.0 * n + -1.0 * i

Explanation of phases:
– Phase 1 (k-loop): N–k strictly decreases until k = N.  
– Phase 2 (j-loop): m–j strictly decreases until j = m, with N–k = 0.  
– Phase 3 (i-loop): n–i strictly decreases until i = n, with N–k = 0 and m–j = 0.
