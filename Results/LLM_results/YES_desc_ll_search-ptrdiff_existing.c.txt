1.0 * (*(int*)ptr) + -1.0 * m

Explanation: At each iteration of the loop in search(), the current node’s value (*(int*)ptr) starts at n−1 and strictly decreases by 1 until it equals m, so f(ptr,m)=(*(int*)ptr)−m is a non‐negative affine function that decreases by 1 on every loop iteration and hence proves termination.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * (*(int*)ptr) + -1.0 * m

This ranking function f(ptr,m)=*(int*)ptr–m is always ≥0 on entry to the loop (since the list values start at n–1≥m) and decreases by exactly 1 each iteration (each next node’s value is one less), reaching 0 when *(int*)ptr==m.
