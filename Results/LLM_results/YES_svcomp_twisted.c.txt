f₁(k,i,j,l) = k – i  
f₂(k,i,j,l) = l – j  

Explanation:  
– On every L1‐to‐L1 or L1‐to‐L2 transition i increases by 1 (so k–i strictly decreases, f₂ unchanged).  
– On every L2‐to‐L2 or L2‐to‐L1 transition j increases by 1 (so l–j strictly decreases, f₁ unchanged).  
Both components stay non‐negative in all reachable states, hence (f₁,f₂) is a lexicographic ranking function.
