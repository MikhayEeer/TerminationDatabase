1.0 * length(curr)

where length(curr) denotes the number of nodes on the list from curr to the end (so length(NULL)=0), and each loop iteration does  
 curr := curr→next  
which strictly decreases length(curr) by 1 until it reaches 0.

linear

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
rank(curr)

[EXPLANATION]
Here rank is an abstract non‐negative integer function on the heap nodes, defined so that rank(x) = the number of remaining nodes from x to the end of the list. On each loop iteration curr moves to curr->next, and by construction rank(curr->next) = rank(curr) – 1, which is a strict decrease. When curr->next == NULL, rank(curr) = 0 and the loop exits.
