Explanation:  
The `search` function iterates through a linked list starting from the `head` node until it either finds a node with the given value `m` or reaches the end of the list (`curr->next != NULL`). Each iteration moves to the next node in the list. Since the list is constructed with `n` nodes (from the `init_list` function), the loop in the `search` function will terminate after at most `n` iterations as it either finds the value or reaches the end of the list. Thus, the program is terminating.
