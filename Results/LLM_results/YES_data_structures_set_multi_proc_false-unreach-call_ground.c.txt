[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
100000 - v

This program will terminate because the main loop iterating over `v` runs from 0 to 100000 with `v` incrementing each time, and there are no operations that can cause it to repeat indefinitely or backtrack. The ranking function `100000 - v` decreases with each iteration of the loop, which indicates termination.
