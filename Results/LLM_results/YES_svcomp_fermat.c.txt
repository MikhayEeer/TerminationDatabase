[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1st phase: c, which decreases until it exceeds MAX  
2nd phase: b, which resets to 1 when c increases and itself increases until it exceeds MAX  
3rd phase: a, which resets to 1 when b increases and itself increases until it exceeds MAX  

Explanation: This program will terminate because it iterates over a finite bounded space defined by `1 <= a, b, c <= MAX`. Once `c` exceeds `MAX`, the loop breaks. The nested loops increment in a way that fully explores this bounded space, and thus terminates.
