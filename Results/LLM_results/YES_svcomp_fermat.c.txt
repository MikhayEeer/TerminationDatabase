1.0 * 1 - 1.0 * c^1 + 1.0 * 1
0.0 * 1 - 1.0 * b^1 + 0.0 * 1
0.0 * 1 - 1.0 * a^1 + 0.0 * 1

Explanation: 

The given program iterates over triplets (a, b, c) to check if a^3 = b^3 + c^3. During each iteration, it increases `a`, and if `a` exceeds `MAX`, it resets `a` to 1 and increases `b`. Similarly, if `b` exceeds `MAX`, it resets `b` to 1 and increases `c`. When `c` exceeds `MAX`, the loop breaks, ensuring the program terminates.

The ranking function is multi-phase, representing the decrement count of `c`, then `b`, and finally `a`, in successive phases, within their respective bounds.

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1000.0 - 1.0 * c^1 + 0.0 * 1  
999.0 - 1.0 * b^1 + 0.0 * 1  
999.0 - 1.0 * a^1 + 0.0 * 1  

Explanation:  
The loop iteratively increments `a`, `b`, and `c` in a systematic manner, each within their respective bounds. When `a` exceeds `MAX`, it resets to 1 and increments `b`. Similarly, when `b` exceeds `MAX`, it resets to 1 and increments `c`. When `c` exceeds `MAX`, the loop exits. Thus, given that `a`, `b`, and `c` are constrained by finite bounds, the loop is guaranteed to terminate. The ranking functions indicate reduction in integers `c`, `b`, and `a` relative to their maximum limits.
