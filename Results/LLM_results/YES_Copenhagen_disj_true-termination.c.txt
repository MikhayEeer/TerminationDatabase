TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
f(x, y) = x + y + 1  

Explanation:  
The program terminates because the linear ranking function \( f(x, y) = x + y + 1 \) strictly decreases for each iteration of the loop. Initially, both \( x \) and \( y \) are non-negative, causing \( f(x, y) \) to be positive. The transformation inside the loop decreases the function's value by 2 each iteration, moving towards the exit condition where both variables are negative, terminating the loop.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
There exist integer values for x and y, such as x = 0 and y = 0, which create the loop condition (x >= 0 || y >= 0) to hold indefinitely. The variables x and y keep swapping their values without decreasing below zero, leading to an infinite loop.
