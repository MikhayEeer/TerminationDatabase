=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
If the nondet int yields i<0, then each iteration does i=iâˆ’1, so i remains <0 forever and the loop never exits.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
If i<0 initially, each iteration decrements i further, so i stays negative and the loop never exits.
