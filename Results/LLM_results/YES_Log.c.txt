1.0 * x^1 + 0.0  
1.0 * xtmp^1 + 0.0  

This program is terminating. The outer while loop decreases the value of `x` by at least 1 each iteration whenever `x > 1`. The inner loop reduces `xtmp` by 2 each time, making `xtmp <= 1` after a finite number of iterations. Therefore, the outer loop eventually terminates when `x` becomes 1 or less. This can be shown by the multi-phase ranking functions provided above.
