TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
nested
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * x^1 + 0.0 (for the outer loop)
1.0 * xtmp^1 + 0.0 (for the inner loop) 

The outer loop decreases `x` by at least 1 in each iteration by setting `x = xtmp` where `xtmp` is decremented by 2 in the inner loop. This shows that both `x` in the outer loop and `xtmp` in the inner loop are bounded and strictly decreasing, ensuring termination.

[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
Phase 1: 0.5 * x^1  
Phase 2: 1 * xtmp^1  

Explanation:  
The program has a main loop that continues while `x > 1`, and within this loop, there's an inner loop that reduces `xtmp` by 2 at each iteration while `xtmp > 1`.  
The outer loop (`while (x > 1)`) can be shown to terminate by considering the value of `x`. In every iteration of the outer loop, `x` is decreased by at least 2. This is captured by the phase 1 ranking function `0.5 * x`, which strictly decreases as the loop progresses, ensuring termination of the outer loop.  

The inner loop (`while (xtmp > 1)`) also terminates since `xtmp` is decreased by 2 in each iteration. This is captured by phase 2 with the ranking function `xtmp`, indicating it will also terminate.  

Thus, this multi-phase ranking function demonstrates that the entire program will eventually terminate.
