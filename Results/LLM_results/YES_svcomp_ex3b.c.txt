y - x

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program is non-terminating for inputs where `x > 1` and `x < y`, because `x = x*x` leads to exponential growth in `x`, but since the condition only checks if `x < y`, `x` can continue to increase without bound, never satisfying the condition `x >= y` to exit the loop.
