TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
abs(x - y)

The program terminates because the difference between `x` and `y` is strictly decreasing in every iteration of the loop, as `x` and `y` converge towards each other. The difference `abs(x - y)` will eventually reach zero, terminating the loop.
