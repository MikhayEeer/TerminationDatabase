=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
f(x, c) = x + c  

Explanation:  
The program is guaranteed to terminate because the linear ranking function \( f(x, c) = x + c \) strictly decreases on each iteration of the loop since \( x \) is decreased by \( c \) while \( c \) keeps increasing. Given the loop condition \( x + c \geq 0 \), \( f(x, c) \) will eventually become negative, causing the loop to exit.

[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * (x + c)^1
