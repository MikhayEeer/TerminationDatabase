The values of `i` and `j` oscillate without reaching a condition to exit the loop. When `j > 51`, `i` increments and `j` decrements, causing `i` to steadily approach `j`. However, when `j <= 51`, `i` decrements and `j` increments, effectively reversing the progress and ensuring that the loop condition `i < j` can be maintained indefinitely.
