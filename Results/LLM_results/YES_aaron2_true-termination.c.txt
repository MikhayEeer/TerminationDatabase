[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The values of `x` and `y` can be adjusted such that the loop condition `x >= y` remains true indefinitely, leading to non-termination. For example, if `tx` is set to 0, and if the initial values of `x` and `y` are equal, the loop may iterate indefinitely without ensuring progress towards termination.
