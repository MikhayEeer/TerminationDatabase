[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The value of `x` remains constant while `y` continuously increments. If initially `x > y`, the condition `x > y` will eventually be violated once `y` catches up to or surpasses `x`, causing the loop to terminate. However, in the case where both `x` and `y` start at equal values, such as when `x = y`, the condition `x > y` is never satisfied, and thus the loop never executes, leading to termination. Additionally, if initially `x < y`, the loop does not execute. Overall, despite the loop having paths that reach termination, in scenarios where `x` is constantly greater than `y`, the loop will continue indefinitely.
