[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * i^1
-1.0 * i^1 + 1.0 * y^1

The program terminates as the function `subxy` makes progress towards termination through two distinct phases. In the first `while` loop, the variable `i` is decreased from `x` to `0`. In the second `while` loop, `i` is incremented from `0` to `y`. The ranking function for the first phase is linear and reduces with each iteration, and the second phase also has a linear ranking function ensuring termination.
