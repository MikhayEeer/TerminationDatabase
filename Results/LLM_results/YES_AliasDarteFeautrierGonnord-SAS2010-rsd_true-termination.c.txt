We take the 2‐vector (f₁,f₂) with f₁ = db – r and f₂ = da – r.  In each loop iteration:
- if the “then” branch (da– –) fires, f₁ stays the same and f₂ decreases by 1;
- if the “else” branch fires, db– – so f₁ decreases by 1 (and then da is reset to db–1 so f₂=f₁).
Hence the pair (f₁,f₂) decreases lexicographically and is bounded below by (0,0), proving termination.
