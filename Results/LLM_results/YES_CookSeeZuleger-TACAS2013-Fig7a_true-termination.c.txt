Explanation: We use the lexicographic (nested) tuple (y, x).  
- In the “else” branch y decreases by 1, so the first component strictly decreases.  
- In the “then” branch y stays the same, but x decreases by 1, so the second component strictly decreases while the first is non-increasing.  
All components range over nonnegative integers, yielding a well‐founded ordering and hence termination.
