For branch (x < 0): 0 * x^1 + c (where c is a constant)
For branch (0 <= x <= 30): x (linear function decreasing in steps of 1)
For branch (x > 30): 35 - x (linear function decreasing in steps of 5 when entering region)
For else branch: c (where c is a constant, leads directly to termination) 

Explanation:
- The program eventually sets `x` to 0 in all cases, which breaks the loop.
- For the range `0 <= x <= 30`, `x` is decreased by 1 in each iteration until it becomes 0.
- For `x < 0`, it is set to -5, leading to `x = 0` in the next loop.
- For `x > 30`, `x` is set to 35 and then transitions to `x = 0`.
- When `x` is not in these ranges, it is directly set to 0, ensuring termination.
