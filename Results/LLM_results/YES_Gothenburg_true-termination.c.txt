=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
f(x, y, a, b) = x + y  

The program is terminating. The loop terminates due to the linear ranking function \( f(x, y, a, b) = x + y \), which decreases in every loop iteration as long as the invariant \( a = b \) holds.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * x^1 + 1.0 * y^1  

This program is terminating because the ranking function \( f(x, y) = x + y \) decreases with every iteration of the loop as long as \( a = b \), which is ensured by the condition before entering the loop.
