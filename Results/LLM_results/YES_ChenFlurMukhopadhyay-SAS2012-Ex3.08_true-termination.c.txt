Consider the non-linear expression: T(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2. 

The initial condition is T(x, y, z) = (x - y)^2.

After each iteration of the loop, x is updated to the value -x + y which produces a decrease in the expression as follows: 

T(-x + y, z, z + 1) = (-x + y)^2 + z^2.

Notice that T(-x + y, z, z + 1) < T(x, y, z) for any change, ensuring that the loop is decreasing.

Thus, the ranking function T(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 is a non-linear ranking function proving the termination of the program.
