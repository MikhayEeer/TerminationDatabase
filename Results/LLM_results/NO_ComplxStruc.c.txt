=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
For any initial i>0 the loop reaches a region (e.g. j∈{4,5}, i≥j) where each iteration increases i (by 1 or 2) and makes j oscillate between 4 and 5, so i never drops to ≤0 and the loop never terminates.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
For any initial i≥1 the loop eventually reaches j=5, i>j, and then alternates between the “j≥5” and “j<5” cases: on “j≥5” it does i→i+1, j→j−1 (5→4), and on “j<5” it does i→i+2, j→j+1 (4→5).  This 2-step cycle keeps i>0 forever, so the loop never terminates.
