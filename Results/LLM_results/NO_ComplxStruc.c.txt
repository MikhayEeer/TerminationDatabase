=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The value of `i` increases indefinitely in some branches (e.g., `i = i+1` when `i >= j`), creating a scenario where the loop condition `i > 0` is never invalidated, leading to potential non-termination. Additionally, the adjustements of `j` are insufficient to guarantee termination as they counterbalance or increment/decrement without converging.

=== Response 2 ===
```c
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The value of `i` can keep increasing without bound in certain paths, specifically when the condition `i >= j` is true. If `i` starts positive and `j` is initially equal to `i`, the conditions allow `i` to be incremented continuously, leading to non-termination.
