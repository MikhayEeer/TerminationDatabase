Phase 1: φ₁(j,n) = n − j  
Phase 2: φ₂(head) = length_of_list(head)  

Explanation:  
– In init_list the loop counter j increases from 0 up to n−1, so φ₁ decreases by 1 each iteration and reaches 0 when the loop exits.  
– In skip each iteration advances head to head->next, strictly decreasing the number of remaining nodes (length_of_list(head)), and when that reaches 0 the loop terminates.

Phase 1 (init_list loop): f₁(n,j) = n − j  
Phase 2 (skip loop): f₂(head) = number of nodes remaining in the list starting at head
