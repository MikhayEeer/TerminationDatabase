[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program is non-terminating for the input values \(x = -1\), \(y = 1\), and \(z = -1\). In this scenario, the loop continues indefinitely because the updates to variables \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) ensure that \(x\) remains negative, maintaining the loop condition \(x < 0\).
