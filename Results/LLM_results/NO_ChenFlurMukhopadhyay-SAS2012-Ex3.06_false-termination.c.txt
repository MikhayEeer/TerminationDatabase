[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program is non-terminating for the initial values x = -1, y = 1, z = -1 because the value of x will remain -1 in every iteration, resulting in an infinite loop.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program is non-terminating for initial values x = -1, y = 1, z = -1. In each loop iteration, x remains negative because z = -2*y is assigned which makes z negative or zero depending on y. Thus, x keeps decreasing or stays constant, never reaching a positive value, leading to an infinite loop.
