[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
For example, with x=−1, y=1, z=−1 one shows by induction that after k iterations x_k=−k²+k−2<0 for all k, so the loop condition x<0 never fails.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
For example, with x=−1, y=1, z=−1 we have each step x:=x+z = x−2y and y increases, so x stays negative forever and the loop never exits.
