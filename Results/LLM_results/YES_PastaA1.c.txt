[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
x

The program is terminating because the outer loop decreases `x` by 1 in each iteration, which is a positive integer. The inner loop increments `y` until it is equal to `x`, but since `x` is eventually decremented to zero, it guarantees termination. The linear ranking function `x` shows that with each iteration of the outer loop, the value of `x` decreases, ensuring the program's termination.
