[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
Outer loop: 10 - *x1
Inner loop: *x2 - 1

The outer loop decreases *x1 from an initial value less than or equal to 10 to a value greater than 10, ensuring its execution is finite. The inner loop decrements *x2 from 1000 to 1, which is finite as well. Together, these nested loops ensure the program terminates.
