[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
The program terminates because it processes the strings `s1` and `s2` in a sequential manner. For each character in `s1`, it performs a scan over `s2`, which has a finite and bounded length as both strings are null-terminated. The linear ranking function can be based on the length of `s1`, where each iteration of the outer loop decreases the remaining length of `s1` by 1, eventually reaching its end and terminating the function.

Lexicographical order over the remaining string lengths of s1 and s2

Explanation: The function `cstrpbrk` systematically moves through each character in the first string `s1` and attempts to locate it within the second string `s2`. The loops through `s1` and `s2` are confined to the lengths of the strings which are finite due to the null-terminated condition enforced by string construction and the single null character. Furthermore, no branching or recursion alters the loop structure in a way that could introduce a non-terminating condition. Hence, the function will always terminate after all elements have been processed. The ranking function uses the lengths of `s1` and `s2`, both of which decrease as the search progresses.
