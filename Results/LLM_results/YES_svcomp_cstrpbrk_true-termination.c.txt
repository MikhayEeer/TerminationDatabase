1. Decreasing length of the strings `s1` and `s2` guarantees termination.
2. Each iteration of the loop in `cstrpbrk` either progresses through `s1` or upon matching, returns immediately.

Explanation: 

The function `cstrpbrk` effectively iterates over the elements in `s1` and for each element, iterates over `s2` to find a matching character. The outer loop reduces the length of `s1` by progressing through each character until the null-terminator is reached, at which point the function returns 0. The inner loop also ensures progress through `s2` unless a match is found, causing an immediate return. Thus, the function is terminating. The ranking function indicates that the overall progress is ensured through the bounded traversal of the input strings.

TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
4.0 * 1 + 1.0 * `(length` of `s1` - current index of `sc1`)^1 + 4.0 * 1  

The `cstrpbrk` function iterates over the characters of the string `s1` until it either finds a character also present in `s2` or reaches the null-terminating character, eventually terminating in both scenarios. The presence of the null character guarantees that loops will not continue indefinitely since each iteration strictly moves forward through the string `s1`, reducing the difference between the length of `s1` and the current index, ensuring termination.
