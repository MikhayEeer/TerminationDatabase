1.0 * n₁^1 + -1.0 * (sc1 – s1)^1
1.0 * n₂^1 + -1.0 * (s – s2)^1

Explanation:
– Let n₁ = the length of the string s1 (so that s1[n₁–1]=='\0'), and sc1 be the current pointer in the outer loop over s1.  
– Let n₂ = the length of the string s2, and s be the current pointer in the inner loop over s2.  
Phase 1 ranking f₁ = n₁ – (sc1–s1) decreases by one each time the outer loop advances to the next character.  
Phase 2 ranking f₂ = n₂ – (s–s2) decreases within each inner scan, and when the inner loop restarts f₂ is reset while f₁ strictly decreases.

[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
nested
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
length(s1) - (sc1 - s1)
length(s2) - (s - s2)

Explanation of the ranking functions:

– We view the two loops (“while (*sc1!='\0') … while (*s!='\0' && *s!=c) …”) as a nested/lexicographic ranking:

  1. Outer phase φ₁ = |s1| − (sc1 − s1)  
     Every time the inner loop finishes without returning, sc1 advances by 1, so φ₁ strictly decreases and the inner pointer s is reset.

  2. Inner phase φ₂ = |s2| − (s − s2)  
     During each execution of the inner loop, s advances by 1, so φ₂ strictly decreases until the inner loop exits.

Both |s1| and |s2| are the (finite) lengths of the null‐terminated input strings. Since both phases are bounded below by 0 and decrease on every iteration in the lexicographic order, the program must terminate.
