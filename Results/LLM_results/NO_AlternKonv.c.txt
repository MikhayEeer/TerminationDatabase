[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
abs(i) 

Explanation: The program will always make `i` move towards 0 due to the conditional operations inside the loop. If `i` is negative, the operations will increase its absolute value by 2 at most once and then toggle it to a non-negative value that will keep decreasing towards zero. If `i` is positive, it will decrease and eventually toggle to a non-positive value. Each operation in the loop ensures that the absolute value of `i` decreases, leading to termination.
