[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * (tk + 1 - k)^1 + 0.0  
0.0  



Explanation:  
The program will terminate because the value of `k` always decreases in each iteration of the loop according to a condition in the loop guard: `k >= tk + 1`. In addition, the values of `i` and `j` being updated do not affect this condition significantly in a way that could violate the loop's termination. Therefore, a multi-phase ranking function is given based on the decrement of `k`.
