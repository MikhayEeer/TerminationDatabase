lexicographic
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
an - i + 1
bn - j + 1

Explanation of the lexicographic descent:

• In any iteration where i is incremented (the “i‐update”), the first component an − i + 1 strictly decreases by 1, while the second component bn − j + 1 stays the same.

• In any iteration where j is updated (the “j‐update”), one has k ≥ tk + 1 from the loop‐guard, so j increases by at least 1. Hence bn − j + 1 strictly decreases by at least 1, while the first component an − i + 1 does not increase.

Since both components remain non‐negative as long as the loop‐condition holds (i ≤ an or j ≤ bn), and every loop step makes a strict lexicographic descent, the loop must terminate.
