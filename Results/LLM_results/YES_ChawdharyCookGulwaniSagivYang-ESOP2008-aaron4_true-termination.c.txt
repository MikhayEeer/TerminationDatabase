[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The conditions involving nondeterministic integers and updates, especially with variables `i`, `j`, and `k`, combined with the nondeterministic behavior of `k` and `tk`, allow for infinite alternations that prevent the loop from always making progress. The complexity and variability from multiple conditions and nondeterministic assignments make it possible for infinite execution paths.

[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * (tk - k) + 0.0 * i + 0.0 * j + 0.0 * 1  
0.0 * i + 0.0 * j + 1.0 * (an - i) + 1.0 * (bn - j) + 0.0 * 1  

The ranking functions are based on the condition that the term `k` is decreasing with each iteration when `k >= tk + 1` holds. Additionally, the loop will eventually break due to the conditions involving `an`, `bn`, `i`, `j`. The multi-phase ranking function captures the fact that the program's progression can be broken into distinct phases where different variables decrease.
