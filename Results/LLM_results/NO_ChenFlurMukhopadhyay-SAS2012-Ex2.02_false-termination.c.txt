NONTERM
[REASON]
If x<0 and y≤0 (e.g. x=–1, y=0), then each step x stays negative while y decreases, so the loop guard x<0 remains true forever.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
For any y0>0 and x0<−y0(y0+1)/2, one shows x_i = x0 + i·y0 − i(i−1)/2 <0 for all i, so the loop never exits.
