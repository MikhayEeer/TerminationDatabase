– For states satisfying y > 0: φ₁(q,y) = y  
– For states satisfying y ≤ 0: φ₂(q,y) = q  

Explanation:  
  • If y>0 then the “then”‐branch fires, y is set to 0 < y, so φ₁ strictly decreases.  
  • Once y≤0, we stay in the “else”‐branch forever, and each step does q := q−1 so φ₂ strictly decreases.  
  • Both φ₁ and φ₂ map into the well‐founded naturals on their respective regions.
