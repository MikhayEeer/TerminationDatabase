(q > 0 && y > 0) -> q
(q > 0 && y <= 0) -> q + y

The program is terminating. The ranking function can be shown in two cases: 
1. For the case where `y > 0`, `y` is set to 0 and `q` is non-deterministically updated, leading the program to eventually decrease in the next phase.
2. For the case where `y <= 0`, `q` and `y` are both systematically decreased thereby eventually reaching the termination condition.

1. q, when y <= 0 
2. 1, when y > 0

Explanation:

This program consists of a loop that continues executing while `q > 0`. The update rules for `q` and `y` depend on the value of `y`:

1. If `y > 0`, `y` is set to `0`, and `q` is assigned a nondeterministic value. The key here is that even though `q` gets a nondeterministic value, `y` becomes `0`, which leads us to the second piece of the ranking function.

2. When `y <= 0`, the updates become deterministic: `y` decreases by `1`, and `q` decreases by `1`. Since `q` is positive and decreases with every iteration, it will inevitably reach `0`, which breaks the loop.

These two components together form a piecewise ranking function, effectively reducing the values in a way that guarantees termination.
