TERMINATE

linear  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
100000 - i  
100000 - x  

The program consists of a series of for-loops that iterate a fixed number of times, specifically 100000 in each loop. Thus, the termination is mainly dependent on the value of `i` and `x` starting from 0 and incrementing by 1 up to 99999. This can be shown to terminate by a simple linear ranking function of `100000 - i` for the `i` loops and `100000 - x` for the `x` loop. Each decreases in each step, thus leading to termination.

[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
100000 - i  
100000 - x  

The program loops each have a defined number of iterations, i.e., 100000. The decrements in the ranking functions indicate progress toward termination as i and x increase from 0 to 99999, ensuring the termination of each loop. Thus, the program is terminating.
