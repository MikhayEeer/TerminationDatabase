=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
There is an infinite execution for example x=0, y=11: then each loop sets x = −y < 10 and increments y, so the guard x<10 always holds and the loop never terminates.

[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
For example from (x=0,y=11) each step sets x=−y<10 and y→y+1 so the guard stays true forever.
