[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The loop can continuously execute without ever reaching the termination condition when starting with values such as x = 0 and y = 11. In this scenario, x is assigned -y in each iteration, and y is incremented by 1. Since -y is always less than 10, the loop condition is perpetually satisfied and does not terminate.
