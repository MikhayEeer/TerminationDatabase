[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program contains an inner loop where `xtmp` is repeatedly set to `xtmp - y` as long as `xtmp >= y && y > 0`. There exists cases where `y` and `xtmp` never reach zero, such as when both start with the same positive value, leading to a scenario where the outer loop condition `y > 0 && x > 0` remains true indefinitely.
