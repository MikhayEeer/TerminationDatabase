-- Piece 1 (y ≤ 0):  
   f₁(x,y) = x  
   • In this case y≤0 ⇒ on the very next iteration x′=−x+y−5≤−x−5<0, so the loop guard (x′>0) fails and the loop exits.  
-- Piece 2 (y > 0):  
   f₂(x,y) = n − x  
   • If the loop stays in this piece then 0<x<n and y>0, and either x′≥n (so the guard fails and we exit) or x′<n and  
      n−x′ = n−(−x+y−5) = (n−x) + (2x+5−y) < n−x  
      as soon as y>2x+5.  Since y doubles every round, eventually y>2x+5 and so f₂ strictly decreases until the loop exits.
