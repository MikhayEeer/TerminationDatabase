1. A potential non-linear ranking function for this loop could be based on the invariant that relates the variables: \( x = -(y / 2^k) + 5k + c \), where \( k \) is the number of iterations executed so far and \( c \) is some constant dependent on initial values of \( x, y, \) and \( n \). As \( k \) increases, the impact of the \( -(y / 2^k) \) term grows due to the exponential increase in \( y \), eventually causing \( x \) to break the bounds \( 0 < x < n \), leading to termination.

[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1st Phase: f(x, y) = x  
2nd Phase: f(x, y) = n - x

Explanation:  
In the first phase, the value of `x` starts as positive and decreases until it becomes non-positive or greater than or equal to `n`. The transformation `x = -x + y - 5` will ultimately make `x` non-positive if `y` is sufficiently large. Once `x` becomes non-positive, the loop condition fails and the program terminates. Hence, this program is terminating.
