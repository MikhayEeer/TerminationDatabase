[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
The program is terminating because as the loop executes, the variable `x` gets assigned a new value as `-x + y - 5` and `y` values double each time. Here's how it converges towards termination:  
- Initially, `x > 0` and `x < n`.  
- Each iteration causes `x` to change its sign and decrease in absolute value due to the subtraction `- 5`.
- The variable `y` doubles, accelerating the decrease in `x` when loop conditions continue to check.
- As this induces a change towards meeting the termination condition of `x <= 0` or `x >= n`, eventually the loop exits.

In specific, there isn't an explicit single mathematical function because the termination arises due to a complex state by altering between positive and negative values of `x` via accumulated increments of `y`. This non-linear behavior guides toward termination as described.

[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
Phase 1:
1.0 * x + 1.0 * y + 5n (to ensure y exponentially increases faster than any decrease in x due to non-linear operations)
Phase 2:
0.5 * x + 0.5 * y + constant (as x progresses towards zero or n, proving eventual termination) 

This reasoning proves the program is terminating due to the eventual diverging nature of y, and adjusted constraints on x in each phase.
