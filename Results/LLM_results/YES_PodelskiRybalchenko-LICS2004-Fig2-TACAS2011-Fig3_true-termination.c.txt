Branch “then” (x=oldx−1): f₁(x,y) = 1.0 * x + 0.0 * y + 0.0  
Branch “else” (x=oldy−2, y=oldx+1): f₂(x,y) = 1.0 * x + 1.0 * y + 0.0

Explanation:
- In the “then” branch x is replaced by oldx−1, so f₁ strictly decreases by 1 on every transition of that branch.
- In the “else” branch x+y is replaced by (oldy−2)+(oldx+1)=oldx+oldy−1, so f₂ strictly decreases by 1 on every transition of that branch.
Since every loop transition decreases one of these linear functions over the well-founded ordering of nonnegative integers, the program terminates.

– on the “then” branch (x←oldx−1, y←oldx): f₁(x,y) = 1.0·x  
– on the “else” branch (x←oldy−2, y←oldx+1): f₂(x,y) = 1.0·x + 1.0·y  

Explanation:
- In the then‐branch x decreases by 1, so f₁ decreases by 1.  
- In the else‐branch x+y decreases by 1, so f₂ decreases by 1.  
Both f₁,f₂ are bounded below (x>0,y>0⇒x>0,x+y>0), so every loop transition strictly decreases one of these piecewise linear functions, proving termination.
