The program can enter an infinite loop if `x_ref` is between 2 and `y_ref - 1`, because multiplying `*x_ref` by itself will cause it to grow rapidly, but as long as it remains less than `*y_ref`, the condition `(*x_ref > 1) && (*x_ref < *y_ref)` might still hold true, depending on the value of `*y_ref`. So it is possible for `*x_ref` to stay within the loop condition indefinitely.
