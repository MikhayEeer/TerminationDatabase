=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The value of `*x` is repeatedly increased in the loop, maintaining the condition `*x >= 0`, causing the loop to execute indefinitely.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The value of *x is updated to a greater non-negative value in each iteration, making the condition *x >= 0 always true. Hence, the loop does not terminate.
