NONTERM
[REASON]
If the initial *x ≥ 0 then each iteration computes *x := 2·*x + 10 ≥ * x, so *x remains nonnegative and grows without bound, and the while-loop never exits.

[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
If the initial *x ≥ 0 then each iteration computes *x ← 2·*x + 10 ≥ *x, so *x never becomes negative and the loop runs forever.
