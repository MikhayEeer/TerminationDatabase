For the region where \(x > y\):  
Ranking function: \(x - y\)  

Explanation:  
The program switches the values of \(x\) and \(y\) until \(x\) is no longer greater than \(y\). In each iteration of the loop:
- \(x\) takes the previous value of \(y\)
- \(y\) takes the previous value of \(x\)  

This causes the difference \(x - y\) to strictly decrease with each iteration when \(x > y\). Thus, the program will eventually reach a point where \(x \leq y\), causing the loop to exit, demonstrating termination.

x - y

In the `test_fun` function, each iteration of the while loop swaps the values of `x` and `y`. The loop condition `x > y` ensures that after each swap, the new `x` (which was the old `y`) is less than or equal to the new `y` (which was the old `x`). By using the ranking function `x - y`, which decreases with each loop iteration, it can be shown that the function `test_fun` eventually exits the loop, provided the input values are such that they do not make the loop condition false from the start.
