TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
lexicographic  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * (x - z)^1  
1.0 * (y - z)^1  

The program terminates because in each iteration of the loop, either `x` or `y` is decremented, which reduces the respective difference from `z`. The loop will eventually terminate when both `x` and `y` are less than or equal to `z`.

[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
piecewise
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * x, when x > z
1.0 * y, when y > z

The program is terminating because in each iteration of the loop, either `x` or `y` decreases by 1, and the loop condition `(x > z) || (y > z)` ensures that both `x` and `y` must eventually become less than or equal to `z`, terminating the loop. A piecewise linear ranking function captures this behavior with x decreasing when x > z, and y decreasing when y > z.
