1.0 * length + -1.0 * (p – s)

Explanation:
In the single loop “while (*p != '\0') p++;” we let length be the (fixed) size of the allocated buffer and i = p–s the current offset.  Then
  R = length – i
is always a non‐negative integer, strictly decreases by 1 on each iteration, and thus proves termination.

f(p,s) = N + (–1)·(p – s)

Here, s is the start of the string, p the current pointer in the loop, and N is the (nondeterministic but fixed) length of the allocated buffer.  At each iteration p increments by 1, so f decreases by exactly 1, remains non‐negative (since the terminating `'\0'` is at offset N–1), and hence proves termination.
