– Region “x < y”  
  f₁(x,y,flag) = y – x + 2  
– Region “x ≥ y”  
  f₂(x,y,flag) = flag

Explanation of decrease:  
• If x<y, then flag stays 1 and x increments by 1, so  
    f₁′ = y – (x+1) + 2 = f₁ – 1.  
• Eventually x reaches ≥y, entering the second region with f₂=1; on that iteration flag becomes 0, so  
    f₂′ = 0 = f₂ – 1.  
All fᵢ remain non‐negative on loop‐entry states and decrease strictly on every loop step, proving termination.
