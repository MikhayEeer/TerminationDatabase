[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear    
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
y - x  

The program terminates because the value of `y - x` decreases with each iteration of the loop. Since `x` is incremented in each loop iteration and `y` remains constant, eventually `x` will become greater than or equal to `y`, causing the condition `flag = (x++ < y)` to become false and the loop to exit. Thus, the loop terminates for all integer values of `x` and `y`. The ranking function `y - x` is linear as it shows a decrease at each step.
