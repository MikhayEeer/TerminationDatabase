x, if `x % 2 == 0`
x - 1, if `x % 2 != 0`

The program is terminating because the function `f(a)` decreases the value of `a` in each iteration of the loop. The value of `a` either becomes `a / 2` if `a` is even, or `a - 1` if `a` is odd, both of which eventually lead to `a` becoming less than or equal to 1, causing the loop to terminate.
