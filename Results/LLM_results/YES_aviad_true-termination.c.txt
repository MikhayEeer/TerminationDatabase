linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * a + -1.0

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * a + 0.0 * count

Explanation: In each loop iteration, when a>1, the new a is either a/2 or aâˆ’1, both strictly less than a, so the linear function f(a,count)=a is a valid ranking function.
