=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
For any initial state with x>0 and y≥0, each iteration gives y:=y+1≥y and x:=x+y≥x, so x stays positive forever and the loop never exits.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
For any initial x>0 and y≥0, each step adds y+k≥0 to x (where k is the iteration count), so x never falls to ≤0 and grows unboundedly, making the loop infinite.
