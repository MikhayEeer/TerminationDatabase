NONTERM
[REASON]
If a≥7 and b≥7 initially, then after each iteration both a and b grow (a and b increase by 1 every two steps) and a remains ≥7 forever, so the loop never exits.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The loop induces the recurrence a_{n+2}=a_n+1, so once a≥7 the sequence grows without bound (up to a small even/odd oscillation) and never falls below 7, yielding an infinite loop.
