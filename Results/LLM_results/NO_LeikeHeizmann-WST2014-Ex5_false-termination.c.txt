The program can enter an infinite loop if the initial value of `a` is greater than or equal to 7. Each iteration swaps `a` and `b` and increments `b` by 1. If `a` was initially 7, `b` becomes 8 in the next iteration, then `a` becomes 8, `b` becomes 8+1=9, and so on. The value of `a` continues to satisfy the loop condition (`a >= 7`) indefinitely.
