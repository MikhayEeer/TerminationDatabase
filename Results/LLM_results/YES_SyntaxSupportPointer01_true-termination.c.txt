=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The while loop continues indefinitely as *p starts from a non-negative value and decrements indefinitely, leading to potential unpredictable behavior due to the way malloc and pointers are used.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The loop condition `(*p) >= 0` with operation `(*p)--;` can cause `*p` to decrease indefinitely without ever becoming negative, since the dereferenced pointer `*p` is not reset or modified to a negative integer in a controlled manner, leading to a possible infinite loop.
