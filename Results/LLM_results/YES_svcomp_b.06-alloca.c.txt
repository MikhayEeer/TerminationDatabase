=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * x_ref^1 + 1.0 * y_ref^1

This linear ranking function demonstrates that the sum of the values pointed to by `x_ref` and `y_ref` strictly decreases with each iteration of the loop, eventually reaching zero or causing the loop condition to fail, thus ensuring termination.
