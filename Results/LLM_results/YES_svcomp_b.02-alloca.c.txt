=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 *  (*x_ref - *y_ref)^1 + 0.0 * 1

This program is terminating. The linear ranking function `(*x_ref - *y_ref)` strictly decreases with each iteration of the loop since `*x_ref` is decremented by 1 and `*y_ref` is incremented by 1, thus guaranteeing termination.
