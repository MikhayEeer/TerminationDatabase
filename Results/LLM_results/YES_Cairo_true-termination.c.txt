x

The program is terminating because the variable `x` is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. Given the precondition `x > 0`, the linear ranking function `f(x) = x` decreases with each loop iteration until `x` reaches 0, where the loop terminates. Since `x` is initially a non-negative integer and decreases monotonically, the loop eventually terminates.

x

The program is terminating because it decrements the integer variable `x` in each iteration of the loop until `x` reaches 0. The ranking function `f(x) = x` is a linear ranking function that proves the termination of the loop as long as `x` is non-negative, because `x` decreases by 1 in every loop iteration until it becomes 0 or negative, at which point the loop terminates.
