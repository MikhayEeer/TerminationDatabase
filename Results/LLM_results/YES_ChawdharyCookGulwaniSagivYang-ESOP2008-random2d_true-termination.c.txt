N - i

The program is terminating because the loop control variable `i` increments by 1 in each iteration and is compared against a constant `N` which is set to 10. The loop will execute a finite number of times, specifically 10 times, because `i` starts at 0 and increments until it is no longer less than `N`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `r` have no effect on the termination of the loop. Hence, a simple linear ranking function `N - i` suffices to prove termination. The function decreases in every iteration, going from `10` to `0`, reaching non-positive when the loop exits.

TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
N - i

The program terminates because the variable `i` is incremented in each iteration of the loop until it reaches `N`, which is set to a finite constant value (10). This ensures that the loop executes a finite number of times because the loop condition `i < N` will eventually become false. The ranking function `N - i` is strictly decreasing as `i` increases in every iteration, leading to eventual termination when `i` reaches `N`.
