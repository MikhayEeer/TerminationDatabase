The program terminates because it calculates the Fibonacci number recursively, and with each recursive call in `fibo`, the argument `n` is decreased by 1 or 2 until it reaches the base cases (`n < 1` or `n == 1`). The recursion depth is bounded by `n` (which is initially 5 in `main`), and therefore the function `fibo` will eventually terminate when `n` reaches a value that satisfies the base cases. The program's main function then runs to completion after calling `fibo` with this bounded input.

First, for the recursive function `fibo`, the ranking function relates to the argument `n`. For each call of `fibo` with `n`, it recurses into `fibo(n-1)` and `fibo(n-2)`, decreasing `n` by at least 1, implying that `fibo` is terminating based on a decrease of `n` over successive calls.

Second, for the main function, since there are no loops - just a sequential call to `fibo` and an immediate check, it terminates naturally after the function call and final conditional check.
