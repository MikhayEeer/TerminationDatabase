=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
If x and the second nondet both yield negatives with x > y (e.g. x=–5, y=–10), the loop “while(x!=0) x=x–1” starts at a negative x, decrements further, never reaches 0, and so runs forever.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
If x<0 but x>k initially, the while(x!=0) loop decrements x further negative and never reaches 0, so it diverges.
