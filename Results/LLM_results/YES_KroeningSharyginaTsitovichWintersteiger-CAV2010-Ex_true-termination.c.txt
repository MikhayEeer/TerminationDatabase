[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
255 - i  

The program increments `i` by at least 1 in each loop iteration, and the loop continues as long as `i` is less than 255. Hence, `255 - i` decreases by at least 1 each iteration and is bounded below by 0, ensuring termination.

[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTION]
255 - i

The program terminates because the variable `i` is strictly increasing in each iteration of the loop, either by 1 or 2. Since `i` is initialized to a non-deterministic integer and is compared to a fixed upper bound of 255, `i` will eventually reach and exceed 255, causing the loop to terminate. The linear ranking function `255 - i` decreases in each iteration and reaches zero when the loop terminates, proving termination.
