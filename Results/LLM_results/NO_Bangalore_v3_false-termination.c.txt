TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear  
[RANKING FUNCTION]  
1.0 * x^1 + 0.0 * 1  

Explanation: 
In the given program, the loop `while (x >= 0) { x = x - y; }` decreases the value of `x` by `y` in each iteration. The condition for the while loop `x >= 0` ensures that the loop will continue as long as `x` is non-negative. Since `y` is non-negative and `y <= x` holds initially, in each iteration, `x` is decreased by a positive amount, leading to a strictly decreasing sequence of values for `x`. Eventually, `x` will become negative, causing the loop to terminate. Hence, by selecting `x` as a linear ranking function, we demonstrate that the program is terminating.
