1.0 * (n - pass)^1 + 0.0 * 1    
0.0 * 1 + 1.0 * 1

The program is terminating. The outer loop runs at most `n-1` times as `pass` ranges from 1 to `n-1`, decreasing the iterations of the inner loop every time. The inner loop runs at most `n-pass` times. This provides a decreasing sequence, proving termination.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
(array_size - pass)^1  
(array_size - pass - i)^1  

The program is terminating. The primary ranking function for the outer loop is `(array_size - pass)^1`, which will eventually decrease to zero as `pass` increments from `1` to `n - 1`. In the inner loop, the ranking function `(array_size - pass - i)^1` decreases as `i` increments from `0` to `n - pass - 1`. Because both loops' ranking functions decrease in well-defined steps, the program terminates.
