Let d(ptr) = number of remaining nodes on the list starting at ptr (formally, d(NULL)=0, and d(p)=1+d(p->next)).  
Then each loop iteration does  
  ptr ↦ ptr->next  
and so  
  d(ptr)↦d(ptr)−1,  
a strictly decreasing non-negative measure. Thus the loop terminates.

d(ptr)

where d is the (well‐founded) distance from ptr along the “next” field to NULL, i.e.  
 d(NULL) = 0  
 d(p) = 1 + d(p->next) for p ≠ NULL.
