[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
f₁(z,y,x)=z−1
f₂(z,y,x)=x−y+1
Explanation:
– Phase 1: while z>1, f₁=z−1≥1 and each iteration with z>1 decreases z by 1 so f₁ decreases by 1.  
– Once z≤1, f₁≤0 and we enter Phase 2; the loop condition x≥y gives f₂=x−y+1≥1, and in each subsequent iteration y increments by 1 (z≤1 so the “else” branch), hence f₂ decreases by 1 until it reaches 0 and the loop exits.
