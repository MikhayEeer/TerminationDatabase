[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program implements a sequence resembling the Fibonacci sequence with `i` and `j` initialized to 0 and 1, and iteratively updated in the loop. The condition `j != n` can lead to non-termination if `n` is a Fibonacci number greater than 1, since the variable `j` will never exactly become `n` otherwise.
