=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
Since n is nondeterministic, if n is not a Fibonacci number then j takes on the Fibonacci sequence values 1,1,2,3,5,… and never equals n, so the while-loop never terminates.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
If n is not a Fibonacci number (e.g. n=4), the sequence j = 1,1,2,3,5,… never equals n, so the while-loop never exits.
