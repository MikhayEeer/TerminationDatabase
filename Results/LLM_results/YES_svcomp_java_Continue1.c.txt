[RANKING FUNCTION]
20 - i

The program terminates because the loop control variable `i` steadily increases by 1 in each iteration and is bounded by the condition `i < 20`. Once `i` reaches 20, the loop will terminate. The value `20 - i` serves as a linear ranking function that decreases with each iteration and reaches zero when the loop ends.

20 - i

The program is terminating. The linear ranking function "20 - i" decreases with each iteration of the loop and eventually reaches 0, ensuring termination when `i` reaches 20.
