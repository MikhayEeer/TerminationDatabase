=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
non-linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
The non-linear ranking function is \( f(x, y) = x + y^2 \).

The program terminates because, in each iteration of the loop, the decrease in \( x \) is related to the quadratic increase in \( y \). Specifically, since \( x \) decreases by \( 2y \) and \( y \) increases, the value \( x + y^2 \) strictly decreases, and this function is bounded from below, ensuring that the loop cannot execute indefinitely.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
non-linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
x + y^2

The program is terminating, and a non-linear ranking function `x + y^2` can be used to prove its termination. As `x` decreases by `2*y` each iteration and `y` increases, `x + y^2` will eventually reach a non-positive value, causing the loop to terminate.
