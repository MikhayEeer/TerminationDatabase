=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
Starting from x=1, y=0 we have x→1+0=1 and y→−2·0=0, so (x,y)=(1,0) is a fixed point and the loop never exits.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
For example, with x=1 and y=0 each loop leaves x=1 and y=0, so x>0 always and the loop never terminates.
