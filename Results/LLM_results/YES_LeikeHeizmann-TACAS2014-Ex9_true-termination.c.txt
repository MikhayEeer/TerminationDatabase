When \( q < p \), the ranking function is \( q^1 \).  
When \( p < q \), the ranking function is \( p^1 \).  

In the case where \( q = p \), the loop terminates as it hits the `break` statement, so no ranking function is needed for this scenario. The program is proven to terminate using the piecewise ranking functions provided.

1: If \( q < p \), then the ranking function is 1.0 * q^1.  
2: If \( p < q \), then the ranking function is 1.0 * p^1.
