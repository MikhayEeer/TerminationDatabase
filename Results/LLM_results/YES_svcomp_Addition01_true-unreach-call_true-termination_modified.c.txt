=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * n + 0.0

Explanation: In each recursive call with n>0, n decreases by 1, so the linear function f(m,n)=n strictly decreases and is bounded below by 0, proving termination.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
0.0 * m^1 + 1.0 * n^1
