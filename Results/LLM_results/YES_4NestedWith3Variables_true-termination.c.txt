[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * q  

This program is terminating, and a linear ranking function `1.0 * q` can be used to prove the termination. As `q` decreases consistently with each iteration of the loop (on average), eventually reaching a non-positive value that exits the loop, it satisfies the conditions for termination.

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
q

The program terminates because the variable `q` decreases on each iteration of the loop. As `a` and `b` undergo a linear transformation, they rotate in a plane and their average effect is zero, ensuring that the term `q + a - 1` strictly decreases `q` by at least 1 on average, leading to eventual termination when `q` becomes zero or negative.
