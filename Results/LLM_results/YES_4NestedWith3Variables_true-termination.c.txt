[RANKING FUNCTION]  
q  

The program terminates because the variable `q` decreases on average during each iteration of the loop. Although the transformations to `a` and `b` look complex and involve rotation and scaling, they do not prevent `q` from decreasing. The linear ranking function `q` demonstrates that as long as it starts with a positive value, the loop will eventually terminate.
