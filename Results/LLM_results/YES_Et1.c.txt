[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The while loop potentially enters an infinite loop as variable `b` is increased by `a` in each iteration, while `a` is also incremented. The condition `a > b` may continue to hold indefinitely, especially with negative initial values from nondeterministic assignments, preventing termination.
