[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
The ranking function can be considered as the decreasing value of `maxlen` in the function `cstrnlen`. Every iteration of the loop decreases the value of `maxlen` by 1, until `maxlen` reaches 0. This guarantees termination as long as `cp` is not the end of the string (`\0`). The loop iterates at most `min(length1, n)` times and terminates thereafter.

n  

This program will terminate because the `cstrnlen` function iteratively decreases the value of `maxlen` (passed as `n` in `main`) by 1 in every iteration of the loop (`cp++, maxlen--`). Since the value of `n` is enforced to be at least 1, the loop will eventually terminate when `maxlen` reaches 0 or when a null character is encountered in the string `nondetString1`. Thus, it can be shown that the ranking function `n` (as a measure of progress) eventually reaches zero, guaranteeing termination.
