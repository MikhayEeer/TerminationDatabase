n - 1

The program is terminating, as the function `cstrnlen` loops through a string with a decrementing counter `maxlen`. Since `n` is ensured to be at least 1, `maxlen` will eventually reach 0, causing the loop to terminate. The linear ranking function `n - 1` proves termination by showing that `maxlen` consistently decreases with each loop iteration.
