[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
l1 - i  
l2 - j  

The program is terminating. The outer `while` loop that is controlled by `i < l1` gradually reduces as `i` increments with each iteration, ensuring termination of the outer loop. Similarly, the inner `while` loop is controlled by `j < l2`, and since `j` incrementally increases, it will eventually reach `l2`, ensuring the termination of the inner loop. Thus, the nested loop structure guarantees that the program will terminate.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
Alen^1 - i^1  
Blen^1 - j^1  

The program terminates as both loops have clear ranking functions. The outer loop's ranking function is based on the variable `i`, which decreases until it is less than `Alen`, ensuring termination. The inner loop's ranking function is based on the variable `j`, which decreases until it is less than `Blen` or a match is found setting `found` to 1, again ensuring termination.
