Phase 1 (init_list’s for‐loop): f₁(j,n) = n − j  
Phase 2 (insert’s while‐loop): f₂(curr) = the number of nodes reachable from curr (i.e. the length of the list segment starting at curr)

Explanation of descent:
- In init_list, j increases by 1 each iteration while n is fixed, so n–j strictly decreases and is always ≥ 0.  
- Once j=n the first phase ends and control never returns to that loop; we enter insert.  
- In insert’s while(curr->next!=NULL && …) loop, curr advances one node per iteration, so the number of nodes remaining from curr to the end strictly decreases and is always ≥ 0.  
Both measures are natural numbers and hence well‐founded, proving termination.

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
Phase 1 (init_list loop): 1.0 * n + –1.0 * j  
Phase 2 (insert loop):     1.0 * n + –1.0 * k  

Here, in the first phase j is the for‐loop counter (0 ≤ j < n), so n–j strictly decreases to 0; in the second phase k is the number of steps down the list (0 ≤ k ≤ n), so n–k strictly decreases to 0.
