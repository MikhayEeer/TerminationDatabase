[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1. Phase 1: n (decreases in init_list until 0)  
2. Phase 2: finite operations during insert until insertion completes  

This program will terminate as the `init_list` function operates in a loop that iterates `n` times, where `n` is a nondeterministic integer, and it decreases to 0. After `init_list`, the `insert` function performs a finite number of operations to place a new element in the appropriate position in an already constructed linked list. Both parts guarantee that the operations will complete and lead to termination.

[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1. Phase 1: Decreasing function on the number of insertions applied to the list, which starts with a bounded size n and can be taken to completion in finite steps. In each call to `insert`, at most one element (`m`) is either prepended or inserted in the list.  
2. Phase 2: Constant function during initialization of the list (finite loop over integer n which is checked > 0).

The non-deterministic nature of `__VERIFIER_nondet_int()` does not affect the termination property due to bounded loops governed by concrete conditions (e.g., comparison operations and finite iterations). The program structure (loop over n elements and finite list insertions) together dictate the completion of execution in finite steps.
