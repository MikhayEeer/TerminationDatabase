[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1. Nested ranking function for the outer loop (i < n):  
   n - i  
2. Ranking function for the inner loop (j <= i) when the outer loop condition holds:  
   (i + 1 - j/k)  
  
The program is terminating because:
1. The outer loop iterates as long as \(i < n\), which guarantees termination since \(i\) is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
2. The inner loop increments \(j\) by \(k\) each iteration, which ensures that \(j\) will eventually surpass \(i\), terminating the loop.  
3. Given that \(k \geq 1\) ensures progress in the inner loop.  
Thus, the combination of these nested rankings reduces monotonically, proving termination.
