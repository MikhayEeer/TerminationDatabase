[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
nested
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1. Lexicographic(2)
   a. 1st component: *x
   b. 2nd component: (*y, *d)

The program is terminating due to the nested ranking function that decreases lexicographically. The first component *x decreases when *x > 0. The second component, (*y, *d), will strictly decrease when *x is non-positive, ensuring eventual termination as *y and *d become non-positive.
