=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
x - y

Explanation: The program will terminate because the condition `x > y` ensures that in each iteration of the while loop, the value of `x` is decreased by 1 and `y` is increased by 1. This decreases the value of `x - y` by 2 in each iteration. Eventually, `x` will become equal to or less than `y`, ending the loop. Hence, the program is terminating, and the ranking function `x - y` is a linear ranking function proving this fact.
