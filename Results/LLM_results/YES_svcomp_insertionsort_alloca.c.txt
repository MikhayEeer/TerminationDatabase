[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  

[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
Phase 1: 1.0 * (array_size) + -1.0 * i + 0.0  
Phase 2: 1.0 * j + 0.0  

Explanation:  
– The tuple (array_size – i, j) is a lexicographic ranking function.  
– In each inner‐loop step i is fixed and j decreases by 1, so Phase 2 strictly decreases while Phase 1 stays constant.  
– When the inner loop exits, j may reset but then i increases by 1, so Phase 1 = (array_size – i) decreases by 1, ensuring overall descent.
