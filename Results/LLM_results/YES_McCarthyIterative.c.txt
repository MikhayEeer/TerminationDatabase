for x ≤ 100: f₁(x,c) = –2.0·x + 1.0·c + 202.0  
for x  > 100: f₂(x,c) =  0.0·x + 1.0·c +   0.0  

Explanation of decrease:

– If x > 100, we are in piece 2, f₂(x,c)=c, and the “if” branch does c′=c–1 so f₂′=c–1 < c = f₂.  
– If x ≤ 100, we are in piece 1, f₁(x,c)=–2x+c+202.  In the “else” branch x′=x+11, c′=c+1, so  
 f₁′ = –2(x+11) + (c+1) +202 = (–2x+c+202) + (1 –22) = f₁ –21 < f₁.  

Thus in every loop iteration the appropriate piecewise linear ranking function strictly decreases, proving termination.
