multi-dimensional
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
(n - i, m - j)

This program is terminating and can be proved by a multi-dimensional ranking function. The ranking functions used are (n - i) and (m - j). Each iteration of the outer loop decreases the first component (n - i) when j reaches m and resets j to 0, while each full cycle through the inner loop (i.e., when j counts up from 0 to m) decreases it. The second component (m - j) decreases with each increment of j and resets upon i incrementation. This process ensures progress towards termination, since i eventually reaches n, at which point the loop condition i < n fails.
