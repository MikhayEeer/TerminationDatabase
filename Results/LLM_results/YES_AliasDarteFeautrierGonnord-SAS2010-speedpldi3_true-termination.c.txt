1.0 * (n - i)^1
1.0 * (m - j)^1

Explanation: 

The program contains a while-loop with a nested if-else structure that updates variables `i` and `j`. The loop runs while `i < n`, and during each iteration of the loop:

1. If `j < m`, `j` is incremented by 1.
2. If `j >= m`, `j` is reset to 0 and `i` is incremented by 1.

The ranking function can be understood as follows:

- The first phase ranking function `1.0 * (n - i)^1` shows that `i` is strictly increasing until it reaches `n`. This part of the ranking function guarantees progress towards termination.
- The second phase `1.0 * (m - j)^1` works while incrementing `j` up to `m` and then reset it to zero upon reaching `m`, allowing `i` to increase.

Both functions decrease with every iteration of their respective phases, ultimately making the loop terminate when `i` reaches `n` by incrementing `i` after `j` reaches `m`. Thus, the program is terminating.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * (n - i - 1)^1 + 1.0 * 1  
1.0 * (m - j - 1)^1 + 1.0 * 1  

The program is terminating, and it can be proved by the multi-phase ranking function where the first phase decreases the value of \( (n - i) \) when j reaches m resulting in i being incremented, and the second phase decreases the value of \( (m - j) \) when j is incremented in each iteration of the inner loop.
