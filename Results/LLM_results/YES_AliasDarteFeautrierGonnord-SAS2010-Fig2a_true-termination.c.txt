TERMINATE

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * x^1 + 0.0 * y^1
1.0 * y^1 + 0.0 * x^1 

Explanation:
- The outer loop decreases `x` by 2 each iteration, ensuring `x` eventually becomes less than 2, thus terminating the loop.
- The inner loop with conditions `y >= x` iteratively decreases `y`, ensuring termination of that loop independently. 
- Multi-phase ranking covers both phases: `x` reduction in the outer loop and `y` reduction when `x` has lowered enough to terminate both loops.

[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 *  x^1 + 0.0 *  y^1
1.0 *  y^1 + 0.0 *  x^1

The program is terminating. The while loop decreases `x` by at least 1 in every iteration of the outer loop, and the inner loop ensures `y` reduces or does not grow indefinitely, contributing to the conditions for termination. The multi-phase ranking function uses the value of `x` for outer termination and `y` for the inner termination.
