1.0 * x
1.0 * y + -1.0 * x + 1.0

Explanation:
– The outer loop is ranked by R₁(x,y)=x, which strictly decreases by 2 on each full iteration (so eventually x<2 and the loop exits).
– The inner loop is ranked by R₂(x,y)=y−x+1, which decreases by 1 on each inner‐loop step and is non‐negative exactly when y≥x, ensuring termination.
