q

Explanation: The variable `q` strictly decreases by at least 1 in each iteration of the loop as long as `q > 0`. When `y > 0`, `q` decreases by `y + 1`, and when `y <= 0`, `q` decreases by 1. This ensures that `q` will eventually reach 0 or a negative value, causing the loop to terminate. The ranking function is simply `q`, showing that it strictly decreases and is bounded below by 0.
