[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
q^1

The program will terminate because the value of `q` is strictly decreasing in each iteration of the loop when `q > 0`. The condition `q > 0` is the loop guard, and once `q` becomes zero or negative, the loop exits. The linear ranking function `q` shows that there is a consistent decrease with each iteration.
