First Phase: 1 * (array_size - i)  
Second Phase: 1 * (array_size - j)  

The program is terminating because the outer loop runs from `i = 0` to `array_size - 2`, strictly decreasing the value `array_size - i` in each iteration. The inner loop runs from `j = i + 1` to `array_size - 1`, also decreasing the value `array_size - j` in each iteration. Both phases are bounded by the array size.

[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
- A linear decrease of `array_size` during the execution of the main for-loop of the SelectionSort function.  
- A secondary decrease within the inner loop, scanning from `i+1` to `array_size` as `i` increases. The combination guarantees progress toward termination as the outer loop progresses.
