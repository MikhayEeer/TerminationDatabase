Explanation:  
The program essentially performs a static operation copying data from one string to another until the null terminator is reached. Since `length2` bounds the copied content, and `length1` is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to `length2` to ensure enough space, the loop in `cstpcpy` is naturally bounded by `length2`. This ensures that for any execution, the program will eventually terminate because the copy operation will reach the null terminator in a finite number of steps.

[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
length2 - 1  

This program is terminating because the for loop within the `cstpcpy` function iterates through the characters of the `from` string (nondetString) until it reaches the null terminator `\0`, and the string is always properly null-terminated at `nondetString[length2-1]`. This guarantees the termination of the loop. The linear ranking function `length2 - 1` indicates that the loop makes progress towards termination by advancing through the characters of the `from` string until it reaches the end.
