length2 - length1  

The program calls the function `cstpcpy` to copy a string from `nondetString` to `nondetArea`. The main function terminates once the copying operation completes. The loop in `cstpcpy` iterates over each character in the source string `from` until the null terminator `\0` is reached. Given the initialization of `nondetString[length2-1] = '\0';`, the loop is guaranteed to terminate after `length2-1` iterations. Thus, the loop iterates a bounded number of times determined by the initialized input, which implies that it will always eventually reach the null character and terminate. The ranking function `length2 - length1` decreases in a linear fashion, showing that the program progresses towards termination.

length2 - 1

The program is terminating because the `cstpcpy` function iterates over the `from` string until the null terminator `\0` is encountered, copying each character to the `to` string. Since `nondetString[length2-1] = '\0'` ensures that the last character of `nondetString` is the null terminator, the loop in `cstpcpy` will terminate after processing each character up to this point. The ranking function `length2 - 1` shows the progress towards termination as it counts down to zero from the last index position of `nondetString`.
