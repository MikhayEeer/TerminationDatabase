=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
255 - x

The program is terminating because the value of `x` will eventually reach or exceed 255, which will cause the loop to exit. The linear ranking function is `255 - x`, which decreases in every iteration of the loop, ensuring termination.
