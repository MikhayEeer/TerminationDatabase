1.0 * (x mod 2)
255.0 + -1.0 * x

Explanation of the lexicographic decrease:
- When x is odd, the first component f₁(x)=x mod 2 goes from 1 to 0.
- When x is even, f₁ stays 0 and the second component f₂(x)=255–x decreases by 2 (since x increases by 2).

– Region “x mod 2 ≠ 0”: r₁(x) = 129.0 – 0.5·x  
– Region “x mod 2 = 0”: r₂(x) = 127.5 – 0.5·x  
   
Explanation of descent on each iteration (for x<255 both r₁,r₂>0):  
• If x is odd, x↦x–1 (even) and  
 r₂(x–1) = (255–(x–1))/2 = 127.5 – 0.5·x = (129 – 0.5·x) – 1 = r₁(x) – 1.  
• If x is even, x↦x+2 (even) and  
 r₂(x+2) = (255–(x+2))/2 = (127.5 – 0.5·x) – 1 = r₂(x) – 1.  
In every case the ranking function decreases by at least 1, proving termination.
