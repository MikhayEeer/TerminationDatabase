[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The outer loop condition `(x == y) && (x > z)` could potentially never become false because both `x` and `y` are decremented equally within the inner loop, maintaining equality. The condition `x > z` can continue to hold indefinitely if initially set. Therefore, this program may not terminate, depending on the initial input values of `x` and `z`.
