(length1 - 1) - (p - s)

The function `cstrlen` iterates over the characters in the string until the null terminator `'\0'` is reached. Since `nondetString1[length1-1] = '\0';` ensures that the string will always have a null terminator, the loop will always terminate, making the program terminate. The ranking function decreases as `p` moves towards the null terminator in the string `s`.

length1 - (p - s)  

The program will terminate as the function `(cstrlen)` walks through the string from the beginning, incrementing the pointer `p` and stops when it encounters a null character `\0`. The allocation ensures that there is always a null character in the string. The ranking function `length1 - (p - s)` decreases with each step and guarantees termination as `p` traverses from `s` to the null character.
