length1 - (p - s)

Explanation:
In the call cstrlen(nondetString1), we have s fixed and p initialized to s. On each iteration of `while (*p!='\0') p++`, the quantity R = length1 – (p – s) is an integer ≥1 at loop entry and strictly decreases by 1 on each loop‐body execution, reaching 0 exactly when p–s = length1 so that *p == '\0'. Hence R is a valid linear ranking function proving termination.

R(p) = (s + length1 − 1) − p  

Explanation:  In cstrlen, let s be the start pointer and length1 the (fixed) buffer length; the loop pointer p starts at s and advances by 1 each iteration, stopping as soon as p = s+length1−1 (where we have placed the '\0').  Hence R(p) is a non‐negative integer that strictly decreases by 1 on each loop iteration and reaches 0 exactly when *p=='\0'.
