[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
(length1 - (p - s))

The program's function `cstrlen` iteratively advances the pointer `p` through the string `s` until it encounters the null character `\0`. The main function ensures `length1` is at least 1, and sets the last character of `nondetString1` to `\0`. Since `nondetString1` has a guaranteed null terminator and the loop advances `p` until it reaches this null terminator, the loop will terminate. The ranking function `(length1 - (p - s))` decreases with each step of the loop as `p` moves towards the null terminator, proving that the loop terminates.
