=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
-1.0 * 1 + 1.0 * -op1^1 + 0.0 * op1^1 + 1.0 * 1
-1.0 * 1 + 1.0 * -op11^1 + 0.0 * op11^1 + 1.0 * 1

The while loop in the `test` function will execute at most 4 times due to the condition `splverifierCounter < 4`. Additionally, each inner if-else statement sets an operation flag (`op1` to `op11`) when a corresponding condition is met by `__VERIFIER_nondet_int()`, ensuring that once set, the same branch will not be executed again in subsequent iterations. These combinations of conditions force the loop to focus on the unset operations only in successive iterations, thus ensuring termination.
