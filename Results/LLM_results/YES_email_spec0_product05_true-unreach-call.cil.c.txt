=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The while loop in the `test` function with `splverifierCounter` is under the control of nondeterministic choices for the operation flags (`op1` to `op11`). Execution can always choose not to set the next operation flag to 1, allowing the loop to execute indefinitely without reaching the exit condition `splverifierCounter < 4`.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
4.0 * 1 + 1.0 *  splverifierCounter^1 + 4.0 * 1
0.0162 *  op11^1 + 0.499 * 1 + 0.499 * 1

The above analysis reveals that the program is terminating, which is proven using a multi-phase ranking function. The `splverifierCounter` is incremented in the first phase and caps at 4, while the sequence of operations op1 to op11 ensure that the loop exits once all operations are set.
