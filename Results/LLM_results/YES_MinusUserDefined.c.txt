NONTERM
[REASON]
The nested loops can potentially create a indefinite cycle. The outer loop increments `y` and `res` while the condition `x > 0` holds. When `y` is incremented by the outer loop, it allows the inner loop condition `x > 0 && y > 0` to potentially become true again, causing `x` and `y` to decrease in the inner loop. If `x` becomes positive and `y` remains non-negative after the inner loop completes, the outer loop will run again, incrementing `y` and potentially repeating the process indefinitely.
