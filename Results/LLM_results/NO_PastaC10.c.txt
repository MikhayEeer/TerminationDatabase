=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
Both `i` and `j` updates are nondeterministic (potentially negative), so `i-j` can increase indefinitely, allowing the loop condition `i-j>=1` to hold forever.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
Both i and j are updated by unrestricted nondeterministic values, so i − j can be kept ≥1 indefinitely, allowing infinite looping.
