NONTERM
[REASON]
If i is initialized to 3, then in the loop i<10 holds but i==3 makes the “if” body skip, so i never changes and the loop never terminates.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
If i reaches 3 (with i<10), the loop body makes no update and i stays 3 forever, causing an infinite loop.
