The nested ranking function can be derived from the recursive function calls. For the function `f(x, y)`, we can use the lexicographical order of the tuple `(x + y, y)`:

1. The first component `x + y` decreases in the recursive call `f(y, x-1)`, as either `x` or `y` becomes zero and the call `f(y, y-1)` or `f(y, x-1)` is reached, where the sum `x + y` becomes strictly smaller than in the previous step.
2. The second component `y` strictly decreases if the call is `f(y, y-1)`, and eventually reaches zero due to the structure of the function.

Overall, this ensures termination because there is a strict decrease in a well-founded order of tuples.
