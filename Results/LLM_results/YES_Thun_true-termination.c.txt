[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
0.5 * x^1 + 0.5 * y^1  
0.5 * y^1 - 0.5 * 1  

This program is terminating and can be proved using a multi-phase ranking function. The ranking function decreases over successive loop iterations due to the expression `y = (-2)*y - 1`, which causes `y` to decrease with large negative steps, ensuring termination.
