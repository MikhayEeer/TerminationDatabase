Phase 1 (when y < –1):  –1.0 * y + –1.0  
Phase 2 (when x ≥ 0 ∧ y ≥ –1):  3.0 * x + 1.0 * y + 1.0

Phase 1: f₁(x,y) = y + 1  
Phase 2: f₂(x,y) = x  

Explanation of the phases:  
– In any state with y ≥ 0 (so f₁(x,y)>0), one loop‐step makes y′=−2 y−1≤−1, hence f₁ strictly falls from ≥1 to ≤0.  
– Once y<0 (so f₁≤0), we switch to phase 2.  In that phase x≥0 and y<0, so the update x′=x+y gives x′<x, i.e. f₂ strictly decreases until it goes negative and the loop exits.
