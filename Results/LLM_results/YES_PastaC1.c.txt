multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * x^1 + 0.0 * 1
1.0 * (x - y)^1 + 0.0 * 1

The program terminates because there is a two-phase ranking function. In the outer loop, the value of `x` is non-negative and decreases by 1 in each iteration, eventually reaching a value less than zero, which causes termination. In the inner loop, for each fixed `x`, the value of `y` doubles until it is no longer less than `x`, at which point the loop terminates.
