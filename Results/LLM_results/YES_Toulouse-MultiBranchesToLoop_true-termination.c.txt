The loop can continue indefinitely if x is chosen such that y and z do not reach 100 based on their updates within the loop. Specifically, if x alternates between +1 and -1 as the loop is approached, the values y and z may continue to fluctuate without reaching the terminating conditions of y >= 100 or z >= 100.
