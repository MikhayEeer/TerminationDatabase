[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * (x_ref + y_ref)^1  
In this program, the sum of `*x_ref` and `*y_ref` is used as a ranking function. Since the value of `*x_ref + *y_ref` decreases in each step of the loop, and the loop condition is `*x_ref + *y_ref > 0`, the ranking function eventually reaches 0 and thus ensures that the program terminates.
