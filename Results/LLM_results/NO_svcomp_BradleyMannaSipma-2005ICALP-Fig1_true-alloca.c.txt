phase 1: 1.0 * (y1_ref + y2_ref)  
phase 2: 1.0 * (y1_ref) + 1.0 * (y2_ref)  

The program is guaranteed to terminate because the `gcd` function implements the Euclidean algorithm, which always terminates for non-negative integers. In the first phase, the sum \(y1\_ref + y2\_ref\) is strictly decreasing as long as \(y1\_ref \neq y2\_ref\). The second phase ensures one of the variables approaches zero when they are not equal, making it a well-founded criteria for termination.

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * (max(y1, y2))^1 + 0.0 

The program is terminating because the function `gcd(y1, y2)` implements the Euclidean algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor of two non-negative integers, which always terminates. The ranking function is the maximum of `y1` and `y2`. We observe that, during each iteration of the loop in `gcd`, the maximum of the two numbers strictly decreases, due to either subtraction operation, ultimately leading to the termination of the loop.
