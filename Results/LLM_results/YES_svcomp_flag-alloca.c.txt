[REASON]  
The loop within function `f` continues indefinitely when `x_ref` starts less than `y_ref`. In each loop iteration, `x_ref` is incremented by 1 and checked again against `y_ref`. Since `x_ref` starts less than `y_ref`, it always satisfies the `while` condition and keeps incrementing without a mechanism to eventually exit, assuming `y_ref` is a constant or greater than `x_ref`.
