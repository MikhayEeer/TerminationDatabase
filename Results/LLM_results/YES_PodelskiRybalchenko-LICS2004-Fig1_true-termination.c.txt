[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1. \( x \) is a linear ranking function that decreases with each iteration of the outer loop.  
2. \( x \) is a control variable for the inner loop which ensures that when it becomes negative or zero, the termination of the inner loop is ensured, hence inducing termination of the entire program.
