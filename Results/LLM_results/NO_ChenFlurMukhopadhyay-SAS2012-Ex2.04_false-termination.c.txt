=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The state x = −1, y = 0 satisfies x<y and is a fixed point of the update (x:=x+y, y:=−2y), so the loop runs infinitely.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
Starting from x = –1, y = 0 the loop preserves (x, y) = (–1, 0) forever, so it does not terminate.
