[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program is non-terminating for input values where x = -1 and y = 0. In this case, the condition x < y is never satisfied, causing the loop to not execute and the program to terminate successfully regardless of it being considered non-terminating based on the input condition.
