=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The loop `while (i < 103) { i = i+0; }` will never terminate because the condition `i < 103` is always true and `i` is never incremented inside the loop.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The while loop `while (i < 103)` contains the statement `i = i+0;`, which does not change the value of `i`. As a result, if the loop is entered, it runs indefinitely, resulting in non-termination.
