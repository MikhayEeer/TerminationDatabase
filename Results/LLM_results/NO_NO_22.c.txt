For i < 50: 100 - i
For i >= 50: i - 50

This program is terminating. The value of `i` first increases from 0 to 50 in the loop, and once `i` reaches 50, it decreases until reaching 100 where the loop exits. The ranking functions `100 - i` and `i - 50` both respectively decrease in well-founded manner as the state progresses through each phase.
