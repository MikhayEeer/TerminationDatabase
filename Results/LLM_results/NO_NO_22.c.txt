=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The variable `i` oscillates between 49 and 50 and never reaches 100.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
piecewise
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
(100 - i) when i < 50
(i - 50) when i >= 50

The program is terminating because the value of `i` initially increases until it reaches 50, and then decreases until it exits the loop at 100. The piecewise ranking function demonstrates this behavior.
