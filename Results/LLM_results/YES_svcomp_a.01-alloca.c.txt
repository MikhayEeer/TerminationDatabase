[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * x^1 + 0.0 * 1  
1.0 * (x - y)^1 + 0.0 * 1  

This program is terminating. The outer loop decreases the value of `*x_ref` at each iteration, ensuring eventual termination. The inner loop completes when `*y_ref` equals `*x_ref`, contributing to a multi-phase termination argument.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
nested  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1st loop: 1.0 *  x_ref^1  
2nd loop: -1.0 *  y_ref^1 + 1.0 *  x_ref^1
