=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
If *x is initially positive and greater than 1, the program doesn't ensure *x is decremented to non-positive values because *y continues to increment, potentially causing *x to decrease less rapidly than *y increases.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The decrement of *x by *y in each loop iteration can be offset or reversed as *y is incremented in each loop iteration, allowing *x to remain positive indefinitely, thus failing to ensure termination.
