The program is terminating. The while loop condition `x > y` ensures that as long as the loop executes, `x` decreases by at least `y` in each iteration. Since `y` is reassigned at every iteration to a non-deterministic value provided by `__VERIFIER_nondet_int()`, the effect of the loop is to drive `x` towards non-positivity (or make it less than `y`), thus ensuring eventual termination of the loop when `x <= y`.

The loop will break if `y < 1` or `y > 2`, effectively acting as an additional termination condition. Note that for each new loop cycle, a fresh `y` is chosen, meaning the loop body may not be executed exhaustively if `y` is chosen such that it doesn't meet the while loop condition or the break condition is satisfied.
