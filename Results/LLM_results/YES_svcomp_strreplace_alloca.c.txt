1.0*length1 + 1.0*s + -1.0*p

Explanation:
In function cstrreplace, let s be the initial pointer value and p the loop pointer. Define 
  f(p, length1) = length1 + s – p. 
Since p starts at s, f = length1 ≥ 0, and each iteration p++ makes f decrease by exactly 1, with f reaching 0 when p = s + length1. Thus f is a valid linear ranking function proving termination.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * length1 + -1.0 * (p - s)

Explanation: we use the pointer difference d = (p – s), initially 0 and incremented by 1 each loop, so R = length1 – d is a linear ranking function that decreases by 1 each iteration and remains non‐negative until termination.
