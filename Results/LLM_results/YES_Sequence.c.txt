=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
100.0 - 1.0 * i^1
21.0 - 1.0 * j^1

These incrementing loops have clear bounds that are ultimately reached, ensuring termination. The first loop increases `i` until 100 is reached, and the second loop increases `j` until 21 is reached. Both loops have linear ranking functions demonstrating monotonic decrease until their termination conditions are met.
