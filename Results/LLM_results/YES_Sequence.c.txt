[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
100 - i (for the first loop)  
21 - j (for the second loop)  

Each loop independently decreases the distance to its respective termination condition: 'i' iterating towards 100 and 'j' iterating towards 21, demonstrating termination for the entire program.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
100 - i
21 - j

This program is terminating. Each of the two loops has a linear ranking function: the first loop with ranking function 100 - i, and the second loop with ranking function 21 - j. In both cases, as the loop progresses, the value of the ranking function decreases, eventually leading to loop termination.
