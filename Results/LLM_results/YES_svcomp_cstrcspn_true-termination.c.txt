f₁ = length(s₁) – (sc1 – s1)  
f₂ = length(s₂) – (   s – s2)  

Explanation:  
– The outer `for`‐loop index i = sc1–s1 ranges over 0 … length(s₁)–1, and f₁≥0 and strictly decreases by 1 each time the inner loop completes without early return.  
– The inner `while`‐loop index j = s–s2 ranges over 0 … length(s₂), and f₂≥0 and strictly decreases by 1 on each iteration of that loop.  
Hence (f₁,f₂) is a valid nested lexicographic ranking function proving termination.

f₁ = length(s2) – (s – s2)  
f₂ = length(s1) – (sc1 – s1)  

Explanation:  
– The inner `while (*s!='\0' && *s!=c)` loop is ranked by the measure f₁, which starts at length(s2) and strictly decreases by 1 on each iteration of the inner loop.  
– The outer `for (sc1=…; *sc1!='\0'; sc1++)` loop is ranked by f₂, which starts at length(s1) and strictly decreases by 1 on each iteration of the outer loop (when the inner loop has finished).  
Since both f₁ and f₂ are non‐negative integers and decrease on each step of their respective loops, the whole program must terminate.
