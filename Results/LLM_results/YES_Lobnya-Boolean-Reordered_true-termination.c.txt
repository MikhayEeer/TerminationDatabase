[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTION]
f(x) = x

Explanation:
The program will terminate due to the manipulation of `x`. Initially, `x` can be any integer, and in each iteration of the loop, it decrements `x` by 1. The loop will break when `b` becomes false, which happens when `x` becomes less than 0 (since `b = (x >= 0)` is evaluated at the end of each loop iteration). The ranking function `f(x) = x` decreases by 1 in every iteration, hence proving termination.
