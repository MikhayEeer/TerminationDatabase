Phase 1 (Function `is_prime_`):  
`m` (since `m` is decremented in each recursive call)

Explanation: The program performs primality testing using recursive functions. The key function is `is_prime_`, where `m` is decremented in each recursive call until it reaches 1 or a divisor is found, ensuring termination. Additionally, the program guards against invalid input ranges with checks in `main`, which also ensures that no endless loop or recursion occurs beyond valid bounds. Thus, the program is guaranteed to terminate.

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * n^1 + 0.0 * 1
0.5 * m^1 + 0.5 * n^1

The program terminates due to the recursive nature of the `is_prime_` function and the constraints applied in the `main` function. The recursive function `is_prime_` reduces the value of `m` until it reaches a base case, ensuring termination. Furthermore, the values of `n`, `f1`, and `f2` in the `main` function are restricted by conditions, preventing any infinite loops. Overall, these conditions guarantee that the execution will reach a conclusion.
