The recursive nature of the `is_prime_` function and the decrementing of the variable `m` guarantee termination because the parameter `m` decreases in each recursive call until the base case is reached. Additionally, `multiple_of` does not introduce any infinite loops since `n` decreases with each call. So, the combination of both functions ensures the main program terminates. The indirect verification through the ranking functions also confirms this termination.
