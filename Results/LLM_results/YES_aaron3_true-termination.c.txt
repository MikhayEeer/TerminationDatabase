[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` can be chosen such that the loop guard `x >= y && x <= tx + z` remains true indefinitely. Specifically, `x` can continuously be reset to values between `y` and `tx + z`, and `z` continuously decremented, without ever meeting a termination condition. The implementation of `x = __VERIFIER_nondet_int()` creates a non-deterministic loop without a guaranteed decrement of a well-founded metric, leading to potential non-termination.
