1) f₁(x,y,z,tx) = max(z,0) + 1  
   – This is always ≥1 and in every “then”‐branch z decreases by 1 (so f₁ strictly decreases while z>0), and in every “else”‐branch z stays the same.  
2) f₂(x,y,z,tx) = tx + z – y + 1  
   – This is always ≥1 (since x≥y in the loop) and whenever z≤0 (so f₁ has bottomed out at 1) every update (both “then” and “else”) makes tx+z–y decrease by at least 1, hence f₂ strictly decreases.  

The lexicographic pair (f₁,f₂) over ℕ² is thus a valid nested ranking function proving termination.
