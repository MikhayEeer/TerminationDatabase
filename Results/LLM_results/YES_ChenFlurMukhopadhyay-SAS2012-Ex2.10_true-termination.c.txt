f(x, y) = x - y

Explanation:
In the given program, the loop continues while `x > 0` and `y < 0`. During each iteration of the loop, `x` is updated as `x = x + y`, and `y` is decremented by 1 (`y--`). 

The linear ranking function `f(x, y) = x - y` decreases in each iteration because:
- Given that `x > 0` and `y < 0`, the value of `x + y` will be less than `x` (since `y` is negative).
- `y` decreases, making it more negative, which further decreases `f(x, y)` in iterations.
   
Therefore, `f(x, y)` will eventually reach a point where one or both of the loop conditions `x > 0 && y < 0` no longer hold, thus exiting the loop and proving termination.
