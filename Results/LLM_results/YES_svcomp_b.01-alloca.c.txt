[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear  
[RANKING FUNCTION]  
1.0 * x_ref^1 + 0.0 * 1  

The program is terminating because the while loop condition `*x_ref > *y_ref` ensures that the loop will only continue as long as `*x_ref` is greater than `*y_ref`. During each iteration of the loop, `*x_ref` is decremented by 1, which means that `*x_ref` is strictly decreasing. Therefore, the loop is guaranteed to terminate when `*x_ref` is no longer greater than `*y_ref`. The ranking function `1.0 * x_ref` indicates the measure is reduced in each step, proving termination.
