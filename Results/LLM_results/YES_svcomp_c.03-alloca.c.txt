[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
piecewise  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1. If \( x < z \): Ranking function is \( y - x \)  
2. Else: Ranking function is \( y - z \)  

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * (y - x)^1 + 1.0 * 1  
0.5 * (z - x)^1 + 0.5 * 1  

The program is terminating as the main function calls `test_fun` with nondeterministic values. The program features a loop that continues while `x_ref < y_ref`. During each iteration of the loop, either `x_ref` is incremented, if it is less than `z_ref`, or `z_ref` is incremented, ensuring that either the difference `y - x` is nonnegative and strictly decreases, or the difference `z - x` remains nonnegative and strictly decreases. The ranking functions indicate a decrease in values ensuring termination.
