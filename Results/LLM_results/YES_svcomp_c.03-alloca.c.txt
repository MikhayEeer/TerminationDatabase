1) If z ≤ y: f(x,y,z) = (y − x) + (y − z)  
2) If z > y: f(x,y,z) = (y − x)

Explanation of decrease:
- In the branch x<z (so x increments): in both pieces y−x drops by 1, and y−z does not increase, so f decreases by 1.
- In the branch x≥z (so z increments): if z≤y then y−z drops by 1 (y−x unchanged) so f decreases by 1; if z>y then we are in piece 2 where f=y−x which is unchanged by z++—but in that case x<z so the next iteration will take the x<z branch, causing x++ and a decrease of 1 in f. All values of f at loop entry are ≥1 (since x<y), so f is a valid well‐founded ranking.
