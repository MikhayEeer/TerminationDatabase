m if m > 0  
-n if m < 0  
The function `mult` terminates because it decreases its second argument `m` on each recursive call until it becomes zero, and performs a simple arithmetic operation for negative `m`.

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
If \( m < 0 \):  
Rank: -1 * m (decreases with each recursive call as m becomes positive)  

If \( m == 0 \):  
Rank: constant 0 (base case, no further recursion)  

If \( m > 0 \):  
Rank: m (decreases with each recursive call as m decreases)  

The program always progresses towards a base case due to the recursive decrement of m when positive, thus ensuring termination.
