=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program enters an infinite loop when `c` is non-negative. In this case, the value of `x` either stays the same or increases in each iteration, thus `x` remains non-negative, causing the loop to never terminate.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The loop condition `x >= 0` with update `x += c` will not terminate for `c >= 0`, since `x` will either stay the same or increase indefinitely.
