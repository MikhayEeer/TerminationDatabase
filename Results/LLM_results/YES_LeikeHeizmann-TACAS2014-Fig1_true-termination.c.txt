=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
Phase 1: 0.0 * q^1 + (−1.0) * y^1 + 1.0 * 1  
Phase 2: 1.0 * q^1 + 0.0 * y^1 + 0.0 * 1

Explanation of phases:
- Phase 1 (when y<1): f₁ = 1−y > 0 and each loop iteration increments y by 1, so f₁ decreases by 1. Once y≥1, f₁≤0 and we move to Phase 2.
- Phase 2 (when y≥1 and q>0): f₂ = q > 0 and each iteration subtracts y≥1 from q, so f₂ decreases by at least 1, ensuring termination.
