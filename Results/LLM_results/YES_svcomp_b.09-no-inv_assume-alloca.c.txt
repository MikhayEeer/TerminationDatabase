=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * x_ref^1 + 1.0 * y_ref^1

Explanation: 

This program will terminate as the value of `x_ref` steadily decreases through the loop; either it is set to `y_ref`, which is smaller (because the branch is taken only when `x_ref > y_ref`), or it is decremented by 1. Each iteration makes the approach to zero inevitable, making the loop terminate. The ranking function `1.0 * x_ref^1 + 1.0 * y_ref^1` decreases at every loop iteration, demonstrating termination of the program.
