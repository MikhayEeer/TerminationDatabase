[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * x_ref^1 when x_ref > y_ref
1.0 * x_ref^1 when x_ref <= y_ref

The program is terminating. For `x_ref > y_ref`, the ranking function `1.0 * x_ref^1` demonstrates a strictly decreasing sequence, moving towards zero with each iteration. Similarly, for `x_ref <= y_ref`, a similar ranking function `1.0 * x_ref^1` continues to decrease, leading the loop to eventually terminate when `x_ref` reaches zero.
