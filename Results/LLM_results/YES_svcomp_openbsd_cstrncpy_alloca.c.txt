[RANKING FUNCTION]
n

The termination of the program can be proven by observing that in the function `cstrncpy`, the do-while loop iterates at most `n` times, decrementing `n` each time. As `n` is positive at the start (ensured by the check `if (n != 0)`), it inevitably reaches 0, at which point the loop stops. This ensures the program terminates.

[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
0.0 * 1 + 1.0 * n

The program will terminate because the main function calls `cstrncpy` with a specific length `n`, and the operations within `cstrncpy` ensure that the loop in it will execute at most `n` times before completing. The checks and operations within the loop serve to either decrement `n` or fill up the destination string (`nondetArea`) with null (`'\0'`) characters, which will always lead to loop termination for any initial positive `n`. Thus, the ranking function `n` is linear with respect to the loop, making the execution of this program finite.
