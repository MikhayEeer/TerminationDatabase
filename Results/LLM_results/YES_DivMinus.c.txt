=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * x + 0.0 * y + 0.0

Explanation:
Under the loop guard x ≥ y ∧ y > 0, we have x ≥ 1, so f(x,y)=x is a non‐negative integer that strictly decreases by at least 1 on each iteration (x′=x−y≤x−1). Thus f is a valid linear ranking function.
