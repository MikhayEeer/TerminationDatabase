[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
f(x, y) = x - y 

Explanation:  
In each iteration of the loop, the value of `x` is decreased by `y`, and since `y` is positive, `x - y` strictly decreases in each iteration. The loop condition also requires that `x >= y`, ensuring that `x` will eventually become less than `y`, at which point the loop will terminate. Therefore, the program is terminating with a linear ranking function based on `x - y`.
