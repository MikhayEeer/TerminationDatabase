Each of the three linear functions suffices to witness a strict decrease in the corresponding branch of the loop:  
– When the first branch is taken, x decreases by 1.  
– When the second branch is taken, y decreases by 1.  
– When the third branch is taken, z decreases by 1.  
Thus the disjunction of the three linear ranking functions proves termination.
