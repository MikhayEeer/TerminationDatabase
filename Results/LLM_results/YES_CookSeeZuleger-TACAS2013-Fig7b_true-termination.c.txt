[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
lexicographic
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * x^1
1.0 * y^1
1.0 * z^1

The program terminates because each iteration of the loop decreases at least one of the positive variables x, y, or z, ensuring eventual termination. This can be represented by the lexicographic ranking function where priority is given to the non-increasing positive integers x, y, and z in order.
