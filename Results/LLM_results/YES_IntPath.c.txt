[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The loop condition `x == y` is always true after the initialization, causing the program to enter an endless loop.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The loop condition `x == y` will hold indefinitely because `x` and `y` are set to either `0, 0` or `1, 1` based on the condition `if (i > 10)`. In both cases, the loop condition is satisfied, and neither `x` nor `y` are updated within the loop, causing it to run indefinitely.
