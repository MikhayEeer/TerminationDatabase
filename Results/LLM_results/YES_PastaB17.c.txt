[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
x - z, y - z 

The inner loop decreases `y` with each iteration and will eventually terminate since `y` decreases and there is no assignment to increase it, thus making `y > z` false. After the inner loop completes, `x` is decreased. The outer loop condition `x > z` ensures the outer loop will also terminate eventually as `x` is decreased and `x > z` will become false. The lexicographic ranking function (x - z, y - z) shows both x and y are strictly decreasing towards z, leading to termination.

[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
lexicographic
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1st Component: x - z (should decrease when inner loop completes)
2nd Component: y - z (decreases to allow the 1st component to decrease)
