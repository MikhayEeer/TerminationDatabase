=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * min(x, y)^1  


=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  

[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
piecewise  

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
min(x, y)  

This program is terminating. The ranking function is based on the minimum of the variables `x` and `y`, which decreases in each iteration of the loop, thereby guaranteeing termination.
