f₂(x,y) = y

[ARGUMENT]
At each loop iteration z = min(x,y). Then in both branches one of x,y is set to z−1 and the other to x+y ≥ z, so the minimum of {x,y} strictly decreases by 1. Once min(x,y) ≤ 0 the loop condition y>0&&x>0 fails, ensuring termination.

if x ≤ y then f(x,y,z) = x
if y <  x then f(x,y,z) = y
