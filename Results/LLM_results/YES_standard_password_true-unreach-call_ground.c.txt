=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
100000 - i, 100000 - x

The program is terminating as the two `for` loops both iterate over a fixed and finite number of elements (100000). Each loop counter (`i` in the first loop and `x` in the second loop) is incremented and compared against a constant upper bound (100000). This provides a simple linear ranking function for each loop, demonstrating termination.
