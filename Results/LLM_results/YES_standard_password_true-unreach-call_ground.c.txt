(1) 100000 - i (where \(i\) is the iteration variable for the first loop running from 0 to 100000)
(2) 100000 - x (where \(x\) is the iteration variable for the second loop running only when the first loop completes without setting `result` to 0)

The program is terminating because both `for` loops iterate through a finite range from 0 to 99,999, and upon completion, the program exits. The `result` variable's value influences whether the second loop executes, but does not affect termination since in the worst case, the second loop simply does not execute.

[RANKING FUNCTION]
100000 - i

The program contains two loops. The first loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < 100000`, after which `i` becomes 100000 and the loop terminates. Therefore, it is clear that this loop is terminating with a linear ranking function `100000 - i`, which decreases in each iteration.

The second loop, contingent upon the `result` variable being 1, similarly runs from `x = 0` to `x < 100000` and terminates when `x` reaches 100000, thus it is also terminating. 

Both loops are finite and have clear exit conditions, resulting in the termination of the program.
