[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * x^1 + 0.0 * 1  
1.0 * (n - y)^1 + 0.0 * 1  

The program is terminating and can be proved by a multi-phase ranking function. The first phase decreases `x` and the second phase decreases `(n - y)`.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * n - 1.0 * y^1
1.0 * x + 1.0 * 1

The program terminates as it uses a multi-phase ranking function that decreases deterministically across phases: the first ranking function `1.0 * n - 1.0 * y` ensures that `y` gradually approaches `n` bounding the loop to finite iterations, and the second ranking function `1.0 * x + 1.0` guarantees that `x` decreases to end the loop condition.
