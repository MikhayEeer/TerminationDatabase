=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTION]
x + y

The program is terminating because each iteration of the loop reduces the sum of `x` and `y` by at least 1, as long as the sum is greater than 0. This serves as a linear ranking function that strictly decreases in every loop iteration, eventually reaching zero and causing the loop to exit.
