1.0 * (i_ref - j_ref)^1  

The program is terminating as shown by the nested ranking functions. The outer loop reduces the variable `i_ref`, which guarantees that it eventually terminates, and within each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop reduces the variable `(i_ref - j_ref)`, ensuring it also terminates.
