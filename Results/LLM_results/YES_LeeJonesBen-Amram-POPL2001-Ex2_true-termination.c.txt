Phase 1: 1st invocation depth of `f`, decreases with the value of `i`   
Phase 2: 2nd invocation depth of `f`, decreases with the value of `a` while using `g`  

Explanation: 

The main function invokes `f` with non-negative values of `i` and `x`. 
1. If `i == 0`, `f` immediately terminates returning `x`. 
2. If `i > 0`, `f` calls `g(i-1, x, i)`. Then `g` calls `f(a, b + c)`, where `a = i - 1`. Thus, the recursive call `f(a, b + c)` decreases the depth along with the value of `i`.  

The function `g` decreases the recursive depth by calling `f` with `a = i - 1`, and the size of `a` decreases with each recursive call until it reaches 0, where it terminates by returning `x`. 

Given the depth decrease through `i` and `a`, the process will always reach a terminating base case where `i == 0`. Therefore, the overall program is terminating.
