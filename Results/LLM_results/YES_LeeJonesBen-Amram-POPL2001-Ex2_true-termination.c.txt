Phase 1: i (decreases by 1 in f(i, x) due to the call to g(i-1, x, i))  
Phase 2: a (remains non-negative and decreases as a approaches 0 in g(a, b, c))  

The function `f` calls `g` with the first argument `i-1`, meaning that `i` decreases by 1 in each recursive step until `i` reaches zero. Furthermore, the condition `if (i==0)` acts as a base case, ensuring termination. Additionally, the call to `f(a, b+c)` in `g(a, b, c)` reinforces that the value of `a` is a control parameter eventually reaching zero, ensuring no infinite recursion. Thus, the program terminates.
