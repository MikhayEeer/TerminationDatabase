10 - i

The outer loop will terminate because `i` increases by 1 in each iteration and starts from 0 until it reaches 10. The inner loop has no effect on the termination of the outer loop because `j` will stay greater than or equal to 12, effectively making the inner loop execute almost instantly. The linear ranking function `10 - i` decreases at each step of the outer loop, proving termination.

[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
nested
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * (10 - i)^1 + 1.0 * 1
1.0 * (12 - j)^1 + 1.0 * 1

Explanation: The outer loop decreases the value of `10 - i` with each iteration since `i` is incremented by 1 from 0 up to a maximum of 9. The inner loop decreases the value of `12 - j` as `j` is adjusted within the constraints of its loop, always increasing `j` so it terminates quickly reaching the condition for the next increment of `i`. Both loops contribute to the decrease in a well-founded manner. Hence, the program is terminating.
