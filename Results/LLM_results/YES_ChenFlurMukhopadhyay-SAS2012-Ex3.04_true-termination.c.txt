φ(x,y,z) = (z – x + 1) / 2^(x + y)

Explanation of decrease:
  – Loop guard x + y ≥ 0 ∧ x ≤ z ensures A = z – x + 1 ≥ 1 and B = x + y ≥ 0.
  – After one step, A′ = A – B, B′ = 2B + 1.
  – Whenever the loop continues (i.e. A′ ≥ 1),  
      φ′/φ = (A – B)/A · 1/2^(B + 1) < 1  
    since 0 ≤ B and A ≥ B + 1.  Hence φ is always positive in the loop and strictly decreases on every iteration.
