[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
non-linear  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
The program can be shown to terminate by considering a non-linear ranking function that leverages the exponential growth of `x`. Specifically, a potential function is `f(x, y, z) = z - x`. As the loop iterates, `x` increases significantly (since `x` is updated with `2*x + y`), eventually breaking out of the condition `x <= z`, hence the loop is terminating.
