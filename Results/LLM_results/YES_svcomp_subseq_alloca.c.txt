[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * length2^1 + 1.0 * t^1 + -1.0 * pt^1

Explanation: Let t be the initial value of the pointer pt and length2 the (constant) length of string t. The function f(pt) = length2 + t – pt is a non‐negative integer that strictly decreases by 1 on each loop iteration (since pt is incremented exactly once per iteration) and reaches zero when pt points to the '\0' terminator, thus proving termination.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * (length2 − (pt − t))

Explanation:
Inside subseq, pt is incremented exactly once per loop‐iteration and t + length2 is the position of the terminator. The function  
    f(pt) = length2 – (pt – t)  
strictly decreases by 1 each iteration and is bounded below by 0, hence the loop—and thus the whole program—terminates.
