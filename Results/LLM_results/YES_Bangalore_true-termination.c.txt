=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTION]
f(x, y) = x

[EXPLANATION]
The program is terminating because the loop variable `x` is decreased by `y` in each iteration, where `y >= 1`. Since `x` starts as a non-negative integer and `y` is at least 1, the value of `x` will eventually become negative, terminating the loop. The linear ranking function `f(x, y) = x` demonstrates that `x` is decreased in every iteration until the loop condition `x >= 0` is no longer satisfied.
