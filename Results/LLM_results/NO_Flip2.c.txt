=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
There is a non‐terminating cycle on positive values. For example:
(5,3) → (5,5) → (4,5) → (5,4) → (5,5) → …, so the loop never exits.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
There is a non-terminating cycle, e.g. starting (i,j)=(2,1):  
(2,1)→(2,2)→(1,2)→swap→(2,1) ad infinitum.
