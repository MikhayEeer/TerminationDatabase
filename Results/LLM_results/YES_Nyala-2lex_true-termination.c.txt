x
y

The program is terminating and can be proven by the lexicographic ranking function <x, y>. Here, x is non-negative and decreases, while y decreases until it becomes negative and resets to a nondeterministic value. Once x is negative, the loop will terminate.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
lexicographic
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
f(x, y) = <x, y>

The program has a lexicographic ranking function where the tuple <x, y> is used. The first component x decreases when y < 0, and the second component y decreases in every iteration of the loop. Since x is non-negative and decreases when necessary, and y decreases until it goes negative, the program is terminating.
