[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1. Outer Loop: *n - *i  
2. Inner Loop: *i - *j + 1  

Explanation:  
The given program consists of two nested loops. The outer loop runs while *i is less than *n, and during each iteration, *i is incremented by 1, leading the outer loop to eventually terminate when *i becomes equal to or greater than *n. The ranking function for the outer loop is *n - *i, which strictly decreases as *i is incremented without changing *n.

The inner loop initializes *j to 0 and increments it until *j is greater than *i. The ranking function for the inner loop is *i - *j + 1, which decreases each time *j is incremented, leading to the termination of the inner loop when *j becomes greater than *i.

Therefore, both loops decrease their respective ranking functions, proving that the program is terminating.

[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
lexicographic
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * (*n - *i)^1
0.0 * 1 + 1.0 * (*i - *j)^1

This indicates that the program is terminating. The ranking functions decrease with each iteration: the outer loop's ranking function ensures the progress towards termination by decreasing (*n - *i) towards zero, and the inner loop's ranking function by decreasing (*i - *j) towards zero once `*i` is fixed during inner iterations.
