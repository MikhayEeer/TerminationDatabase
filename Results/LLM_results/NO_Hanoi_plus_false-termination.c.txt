=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
For any initial x>0,y,z (e.g. x=y=z=1), each iteration yields x' = x+y > x, so x grows without bound and never becomes ≤0, causing a non‐terminating loop.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
There exist initial values (e.g. x=1, y=0, z=0) for which x remains positive and grows on each iteration, so the loop never exits.
