[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
If initially x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0 then each step y → y+1 and x → x+y makes both x,y grow unboundedly, so x never becomes negative and the loop never terminates.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
If x₀≥0 and y₀≥0 then y increases and x:=x+y grows without bound, so x never becomes negative and the loop never ends.
