=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The values of x and y can increase indefinitely, thus no guaranteed decrease towards termination in any loop iteration as long as x >= 0 and y >= 0.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The variables \(x\) and \(y\) both increase when the loop is entered, and when \(x\) is non-negative initially, it will never become negative, causing the loop to continue indefinitely.
