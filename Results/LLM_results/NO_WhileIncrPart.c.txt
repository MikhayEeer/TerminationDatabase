=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program has a potential path (when `i > 3`) where the value of `i` is incremented each time, leading to an increase and potential non-termination as no condition decreases `i` to exit the loop.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
When \(i > 3\), \(i\) increases by 1, possibly creating an infinite loop.
