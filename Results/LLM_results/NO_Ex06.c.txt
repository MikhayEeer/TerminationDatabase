ranking function: |i|, which decreases by 1 in each iteration of the loop.  

Explanation:  
The absolute value of `i` decreases by 1 in each iteration because:  
- If `i > 0`, then `i = i - 1` decreases `i` by 1.  
- If `i < 0`, then `i = i + 1` increases `i` by 1, which decreases the absolute value of `i` by 1.

When `i = 0`, the loop terminates. Since `i` starts between `-5` and `5` and the absolute value of `i` decreases in every step, the program will eventually reach `i = 0`, thus ending the loop.

|i| 

This linear ranking function |i| decreases with each iteration of the loop, ensuring termination. Initially, \( i \) is bounded between -5 and 5. The loop adjusts \( i \) by decrementing it when it is positive and incrementing it when it is negative, rapidly driving \( i \) to zero and causing termination of the loop once \( i \) moves out of the range between -5 and 5.
