[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
If i is initialized to 0, neither branch in the loop body executes, so i remains 0 and the while-condition (0 ≥ -5 && 0 ≤ 5) stays true forever, causing an infinite loop.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
If i = 0, the loop condition (i ≥ -5 && i ≤ 5) holds but neither branch updates i, so i remains 0 forever and the loop does not terminate.
