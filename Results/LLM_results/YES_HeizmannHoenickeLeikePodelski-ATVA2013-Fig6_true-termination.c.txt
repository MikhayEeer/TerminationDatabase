=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
phase 1: 1.0 * x^1   
phase 2: Corresponds to the while loop exit condition `y < 1` which ensures termination.  

The program terminates because once `y` becomes less than 1, the loop will terminate as either the break condition is satisfied or the guard `x >= 0` becomes false. The ranking function for `x` provides a strictly decreasing value across iterations (phase 1), and the condition `y < 1` guarantees loop termination (phase 2).
