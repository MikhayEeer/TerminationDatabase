[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
non-linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
x + y * (y + 1) / 2

The program terminates because the function x + y * (y + 1) / 2 acts as a non-linear ranking function which decreases with every iteration of the loop. Here, y decreases linearly with every iteration, and when y becomes sufficiently negative as the loop progresses, the overall expression x + y * (y + 1) / 2 decreases even if x temporarily increases. Eventually, x will become non-positive causing the loop to terminate.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * x^1 + 1.0 * 1 

The program terminates because as `y` decreases by 1 in each iteration, if `y` is initially positive or becomes positive at some point with `x` being positive, `x` will eventually become non-positive as it is influenced by the decreasing `y`. Ultimately, `x` will not satisfy the condition `x > 0`, terminating the loop. The function `f(x) = x` serves as a ranking function, as it decreases through the iterations until termination is achieved.
