– In the region y ≥ 0: f₁(x,y) = y + 1  
– In the region y < 0: f₂(x,y) = x  

Explanation of correctness:
  1. Whenever y ≥ 0 (so f₁ applies), each loop step does y′=y−1, hence  
       f₁′ = (y−1)+1 = y < y+1 = f₁,  
     and f₁≥1 throughout the loop.
  2. Whenever y < 0 (so f₂ applies), each step does x′=x+y < x, so  
       f₂′ < f₂,  
     and f₂≥1 because the loop guard x>0 holds.  
Thus on every transition one of the piecewise linear measures strictly decreases in a well‐founded domain, proving termination.
