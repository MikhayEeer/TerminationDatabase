=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
For any initial i in [0…10], the variable i bounces between 0 and 10 (up flips at the endpoints) and never leaves the loop’s 0≤i≤10 condition, yielding an infinite “ping-pong” cycle.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
For any initial 0≤i≤10 the variable i bounces between 0 and 10 forever (up toggles only at the boundaries), so the loop never exits.
