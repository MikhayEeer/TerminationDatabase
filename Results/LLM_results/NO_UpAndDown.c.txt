[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
10.0 * 1 + 1.0 *  (10 - i)^1
5.0 *  i^1 + 5.0 * 1

The program terminates because the value of `i` will oscillate between the bounds (0 and 10) moving towards an exit condition where `i` will eventually be less than 0 or greater than 10. The first ranking function tracks increasing `i` values when `up` is 1, with a maximum value of 10 at which point `up` will be set to 0. The second ranking function tracks the decreasing `i` values when `up` is 0. These two phases combined ensure that the loop will eventually terminate as `i` exits the interval [0,10].

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program can enter an infinite loop between `i == 10` and `i == 0`, toggling the direction of `i`'s incrementation indefinitely.
