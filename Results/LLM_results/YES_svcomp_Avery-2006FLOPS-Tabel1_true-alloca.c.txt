first loop: `1.0 * i^1`  
second loop: `1.0 * (y_ref - i)^1`  

Explanation:  
The function subxy involves two loops. The first loop decreases `*i` starting from `*x_ref` and this loop terminates when `*i` reaches zero. The second loop increases `*i` from zero back to `*y_ref`, and it terminates when `*i` reaches `*y_ref`. Both loops have straightforward monotonic progress towards their respective bounds. Thus, the function terminates for non-negative inputs `x` and `y`.

1.0 * i^1   
1.0 * (y_ref - i)^1  

The program is terminating. The first loop decreases the value of `*i` from `*x_ref` to `0`, while the second loop increases `*i` from `0` until it equals `*y_ref`. Both loops ensure progress towards termination by either reducing or increasing the value of `*i` in each iteration, leading to a termination when they exit their respective conditions.
