=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The loop in test() uses splverifierCounter<4 as its exit condition but never increments splverifierCounter, so the while always continues, causing non-termination.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
In function test(), splverifierCounter is initialized to 0 and never modified, so the loop “while (splverifierCounter < 4)” never exits, yielding an infinite loop.
