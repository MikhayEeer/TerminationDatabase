=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The loop can oscillate indefinitely since *x can be either 1 or -1, causing *y and *z to fluctuate between values that might prevent one or both of them from reaching 100.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The values of *x can be either 1 or -1, allowing for the possibility of oscillation where the updates to *y and *z do not progress towards termination, thus can continue indefinitely. *y can increase while *z decreases or vice versa, preventing the loop condition from becoming false and thus causing non-termination.
