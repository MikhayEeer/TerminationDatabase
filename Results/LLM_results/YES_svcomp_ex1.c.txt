[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
\( y \)

The given program is terminating because, in the `test_fun` function, the loop condition is `y > 0`, and during each iteration of the loop, `y` is decremented by 1 with the operation `y = y - 1;`. This means the value of `y` will eventually reach 0 or become negative, causing the loop to terminate. The ranking function is simply `y`, as its initial value is a non-negative integer and decreases with each iteration until it becomes zero, thus ensuring termination.
