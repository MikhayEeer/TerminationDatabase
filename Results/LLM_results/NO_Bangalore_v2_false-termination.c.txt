=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
If y = 0 and x ≥ 0, each loop iteration leaves x unchanged (x = x – 0), so the while(x ≥ 0) loop never terminates.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
When y == 0 and x ≥ 0 the loop body leaves x unchanged (x = x – 0), so the condition x ≥ 0 remains true forever, yielding non-termination.
