[RANKING FUNCTION]  
f(x, y) = x

This program is terminating. The ranking function is `f(x, y) = x`, which decreases with each iteration of the loop as the value of `x` is decremented by `y` each time. Since `y` is non-negative and the loop condition is `x >= 0`, the loop will eventually terminate when `x` becomes less than 0.
