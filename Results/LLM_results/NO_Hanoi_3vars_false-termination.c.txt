=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
If y₀ ≥ 0 then yₙ ≥ 0 for all n, so xₙ₊₁ = xₙ + yₙ ≥ xₙ and x never falls to ≤0, yielding an infinite loop.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
For any initial state with x>0, y≥0, z≥0 we have x' = x + y ≥ x > 0 so x never decreases below 1 and the while‐loop never exits, yielding an infinite execution.
