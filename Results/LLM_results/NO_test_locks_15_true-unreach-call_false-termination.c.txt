[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The nondeterministic variable `cond` can be chosen nonzero on every iteration, causing the `while(1)` loop to never exit.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The loop condition is based on a nondeterministic integer `cond`. There exists a scheduling (or choice of `cond != 0` at every iteration) that makes `goto out` never taken, so the `while(1)` loop can execute infinitely.
