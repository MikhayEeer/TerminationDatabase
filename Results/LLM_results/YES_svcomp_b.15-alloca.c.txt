1st level function: (x_ref - z_ref)
2nd level function: (y_ref - z_ref)

Explanation:
1. The outer loop is `while ((*x_ref == *y_ref) && (*x_ref > *z_ref))`.
   Inside this loop, the `x_ref` and `y_ref` variables are equal initially and continue being modified similarly.
   This condition is evaluated at the start, and once `x_ref` is no longer greater than `z_ref`, the loop will terminate.
2. The inner loop `while (*y_ref > *z_ref)` executes only as long as `y_ref` is greater than `z_ref`.
   Inside this loop, both `x_ref` and `y_ref` decrease by 1 in each iteration.

The nested ranking functions demonstrate this loop's termination:
- The outer loop can be terminated by checking `x_ref - z_ref` decreasing to zero.
- The inner loop is terminated as `y_ref - z_ref` decreases to zero.

TERMINATE

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
0.802 * (x_ref - z_ref)^1 + 0.902 * 0^1 + 0.902 * 1
0.081 * (y_ref - z_ref)^1 + 0.482 * 1 + 0.482 * 1

Explanation: The program terminates because the first loop ensures `*x_ref == *y_ref` and `*x_ref > *z_ref`. The nested loop decreases both `*x_ref` and `*y_ref` simultaneously due to `*x_ref = *x_ref - 1;` and `*y_ref = *y_ref - 1;` and since both are initially equal and greater than `*z_ref`, the difference between `*x_ref` or `*y_ref` and `*z_ref` decreases, ensuring termination.
