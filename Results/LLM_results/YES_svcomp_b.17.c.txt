[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
nested
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
0.5 * (x - z) + 1.0
0.5 * (y - z) + 1.0

The program is terminating because each iteration of the outer loop strictly decreases the value of `x` with respect to `z`, and the inner loop strictly decreases the value of `y` with respect to `z`. Once both `x` and `y` are not greater than `z`, the loops will terminate. The nested ranking functions show a clear decrease towards zero, ensuring termination.
