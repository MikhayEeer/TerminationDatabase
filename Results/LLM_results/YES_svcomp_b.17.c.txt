The program is terminating. The outer loop decreases the value of `x` in each iteration, and the inner loop decreases the value of `y` in each iteration, both of which ensure progress towards termination since both variables are compared against a constant `z`. The nested ranking function first decreases based on `y`, and once `y` reaches `z`, it allows `x` to decrease, ensuring the loops will both eventually terminate.
