[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
Phase 1: 0.0 *x + 0.0 *y + 1.0 *z  
Phase 2: 0.0 *x + 0.0 *y + 1.0 *z  

Explanation of the proof‐obligation discharge:  
– Phase 1 covers all “y > x” iterations that stay in the same branch (“y > x” again).  In order to re‐enter that branch the fresh x must satisfy x′<z, so z′=x′−1<z−1 and the phase‐1 measure strictly decreases.  If instead x′≥z one leaves Phase 1 and enters Phase 2.  
– Phase 2 covers all “y≤x” iterations (the else‐branch).  There z is decremented by 1 on every step, so the phase‐2 measure strictly decreases until z≤0 and the loop exits.  
Hence the two‐phase (multi-phase) ranking function ⟨z,z⟩ proves termination.
