[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * z^1  

The program is terminating and can be proved by the multi-phase ranking function. Here, the ranking function is based on the variable `z`, which decreases in each iteration of the loop and eventually leads to the loop's termination when z becomes non-positive.

[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
0.5 * z^1 + 0.5 * y^1 + 0.5 * x^1
