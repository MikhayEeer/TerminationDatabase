=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
piecewise  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
Phase 1: (11 - x1)  
Phase 2: (x2 - 1)  

The program terminates because it comprises two nested loops. The outer loop increments `x1` until it surpasses 10, and the inner loop decrements `x2` until it equals 1. The ranking functions reflect the progress towards termination in each phase: "Phase 1: (11 - x1)" decreases with each iteration of the outer loop, and "Phase 2: (x2 - 1)" decreases with each iteration of the inner loop.
