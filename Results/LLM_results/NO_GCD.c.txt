1st Level Nested: x^1
2nd Level Nested: y^1

In the given program, the outer while loop continues while `y != 0`, and the inner while loop reduces `xtmp` by `y` repeatedly until `xtmp <= y`. Each iteration of the outer loop effectively executes a variant of the Euclidean algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. This process always results in either `x` or `y` becoming zero after a finite number of iterations, hence ensuring program termination. The nested ranking functions are based on the non-negative integers `x` and `y` which decrease lexicographically.

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
0.5 * |y|^1 + 0.5 * 1  
0.5 * x^1 + 0.5 * |y|^1 + 0.5 * 1  

The program is terminating due to the nature of `y` eventually reducing to 0, either through the outer or inner while loops, with both `x` and `y` making progress towards this termination condition. This is captured by the nested ranking functions that show progress in each phase of the loops.
