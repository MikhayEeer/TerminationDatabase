NONTERM
[REASON]
The inner loop “while (j>0) j=j+1;” strictly increases j when j>0, so once i≥1 the inner loop never terminates.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The inner loop “while (j>0) j=j+1;” only increases j, so once j>0 it never decreases. For any initial i in 1..9 (or eventually when i reaches 1), the inner loop is infinite.
