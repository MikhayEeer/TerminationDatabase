[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * max^1
-1.0 * x^1 + 1.0 * max^1 + 1.0 * x^1

The program terminates based on the fact that:
1. The outer condition `if (max > 0)` ensures `max` is positive and fixed.
2. The loop runs `while (x <= max)`, and `x` is incremented in each iteration by one.
3. Hence, the loop has a finite number of iterations (at most `max` iterations).

The multi-phase ranking function is given:
- The first phase function corresponds to the constant upper bound grounded by `max`.
- The second phase function demonstrates how it decreases towards 0 based on `x`, ensuring termination as `x` exceeds `max`.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear  
[RANKING FUNCTION]  
max - x  

The program is terminating because there is a linear ranking function `max - x` that strictly decreases with every iteration of the while loop, as `x` is incremented by 1 in each loop iteration and `max` remains constant. The loop terminates when `x` becomes greater than `max`.
