[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * max^1 + 0.0 * 1
0.0 * 1 + 1.0 * (max - x)^1 + 0.0 * 1

The program is terminating as the loop iterates while `x <= max`. With each iteration, `x` is incremented by 1, and since `max` is a constant positive value, the loop will eventually terminate when `x` exceeds `max`. The multi-phase ranking function consists of two phases: the first phase decreases by an invariant value, indicating that the condition of entering the loop holds initially, while the second phase provides a strictly decreasing function with respect to the loop variable `x`.

[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
max - x

This program is terminating because the variable `x` starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration of the loop. Given that `max` is positive, `x` will eventually exceed `max`, causing the while loop condition `x <= max` to become false, thus terminating the program. The ranking function `max - x` strictly decreases with each loop iteration since `x` increases and `max` is constant.
