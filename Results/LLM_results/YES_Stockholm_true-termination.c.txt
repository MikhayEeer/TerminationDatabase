[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  

[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear  

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
f(x, a, b) = x  

[EXPLANATION]  
The program terminates with the linear ranking function f(x, a, b) = x when the loop invariant b >= a holds. Since the change in x during each iteration is x = x + (a - b) - 1, and given the precondition b >= a, it ensures that x decreases with each iteration. Therefore, the loop will eventually terminate when x becomes negative.
