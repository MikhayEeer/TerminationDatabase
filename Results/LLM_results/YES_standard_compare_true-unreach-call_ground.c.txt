[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
100000 - i

The while loop decreases the difference between 100000 and i, hence it acts as a termination argument. The loop terminates when `i` reaches 100000.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
100000 - i

The program terminates because the loop has a clear linear ranking function `100000 - i` that decreases with each iteration, ensuring that `i` will eventually reach 100000, causing the loop to terminate. The subsequent for loop is bounded and known to iterate a finite number of times, leading to termination of the entire program.
