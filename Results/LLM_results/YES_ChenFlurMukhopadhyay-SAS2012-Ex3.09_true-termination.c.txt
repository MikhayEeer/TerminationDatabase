f(x,z) = ⎣z / x⎦  
Explanation: In any non‐breaking iteration we have x′>2·x and x′<z, so ⎣z/x′⎦<⎣(z/x)/2⎦≤⎣z/x⎦−1, and f remains a non‐negative integer, hence strictly decreases until the loop exits.

– if y ≠ z: f₁(x,y,z) = 1  
– if y = z: f₂(x,y,z) = z / x

Explanation of decrease on the loop body (only for illustration, not part of the required output):

1. When y ≠ z, any non‐break iteration executes “y = z”, so f₁ goes from 1 to 0 and the loop either exits immediately or moves to the y = z case.  
2. Once y = z, each non‐break iteration satisfies x′ > 2·x, so  
   f₂′ = z / x′ < z / (2·x) = ½·(z / x) = ½·f₂,  
   a strict decrease in a well‐founded order on positive rationals. A break or x′ ≥ z then exits the loop.
