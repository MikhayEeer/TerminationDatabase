Phase 1: Termination due to loop break condition.  

Explanation: The program is terminating because there exists a break condition inside the loop: `if (x <= 2*old_x) { break; }`. This condition ensures that for any `x` not satisfying `x > 2*old_x`, the loop will exit. Thus, the loop does not run indefinitely.

1. (x > 0 and x < y and x > 2 * old_x): -2 * old_x (decreases linearly)
2. (x > 0 and x < y and x <= 2 * old_x): Constant termination due to break statement
