1. if x <= 2 * old_x, the loop terminates immediately.  
2. if x > 2 * old_x, then (y - x) serves as a ranking function decreasing with each iteration since y is set to a fixed value z, providing bounded termination.

0.5 * y^1 - 1.0 * x^1 + 1.0 * 1

The program is terminating. The loop continues while `x > 0` and `x < y`. The assignment of `x` to a nondeterministic value within a constrained bound means the loop condition can eventually falsify, specifically by either `x` becoming non-positive or not less than `y`, whose value does not increase unboundedly relative to `x`. The ranking function shows that the value decreases in every loop iteration when `x` reaches certain bounds.
