First phase:  
0.5 * y^1 + 5000.0 * 1  
Second phase:  
1.0 * z^1 + (-1.0) * y^1 + 10000.0 * 1

1. The outer loop with condition `y >= 1` has the ranking function: `y`, which decreases in each iteration when exiting the inner loop.
2. The inner loop with condition `y < z` has the ranking function: `z - y`, which decreases in each iteration of the inner loop. 

The program terminates as these nested loops contribute to a globally decreasing behavior. The outer loop ensures `y` eventually drops below 1.
