Phase 1: f₁(x,y,z) = z − y  
  – Active while z − y > 0; in each inner‐loop iteration z decreases by 1, so f₁ strictly decreases to 0.  
Phase 2: f₂(x,y,z) = x  
  – Once z ≤ y, the inner loop is skipped and each outer‐loop iteration does x := x−1, so f₂ strictly decreases until x < 0.  
Phase 3: f₃(x,y,z) = y  
  – Once x < 0 and z ≤ y, each outer‐loop iteration does y := y + x (with x negative), so y strictly decreases until y < 1, at which point the while‐loop exits.
