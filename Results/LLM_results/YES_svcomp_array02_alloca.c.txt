[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
nested  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
For outer loop (over `i`): `N - i`  
For inner loops (over `a[i]`): Absolute value of `a[i]`  

The program is terminating because the outer loop iterates over the array of size `N` and the inner loops guarantee to make `a[i]` zero in finite steps, thus eventually terminating both inner loops for every element of the array.

[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
Phase 1: ∑(max(0, -a[i])) for each a[i] < 0  
Phase 2: ∑(max(0, a[i])) for each a[i] > 0  

The program is terminating because for each `a[i] < 0`, the first while loop systematically increases `a[i]` until it reaches zero, decreasing the number of negative elements (`neg`) in the process. Once all negative elements have been incremented to zero (end of Phase 1), for each `a[i] > 0`, the second while loop decreases `a[i]` until it reaches zero, decreasing the number of positive elements (`pos`) in the process. Thus, all elements converge to zero, leading the loops to eventually terminate.
