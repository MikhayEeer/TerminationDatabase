[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
Lexicographic(x, y^2)

Explanation:
The program will terminate as follows:
1. In the first component of the lexicographic tuple, `x` decreases by at least `(y - 5)`, hence eventually it will become non-positive for any initial values of `x` and `y`.
2. The second component, `y^2`, will either remain the same or increase since `y` is repeatedly multiplied by `-2`, flipping its sign and expanding its absolute value.
3. The function `Lexicographic(x, y^2)` demonstrates a nested ranking function because the reduction in `x` contributes to the overall termination, with the change in `y^2` ensuring diverse exploration of values.
4. Eventually, the loop condition `x > 0` becomes false, causing the program to exit the loop and terminate.
