=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
3.0 * x^1 + 1.0 * y^1
1.0 * x^1

Explanation of the proof sketch (for your understanding, not required in the output):

– Phase 1: f₁(x,y)=3x+y strictly decreases by 15 each loop run, so eventually f₁<0.  
– Once 3x+y<0 we have x+y–5<0 and thus the next x≤0 exits the while.  
– Phase 2: f₂(x,y)=x witnesses that final step to termination.
