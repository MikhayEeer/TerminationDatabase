[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The function `sum` recursively decreases `n` until zero, while increasing `m` by the same amount, ensuring a return condition that will never differ from `a + b`. Thus, the `main` function leads to an error if `a` and `b` are integers such that `a + b == a + b`, which is always true, suggesting a contradiction in the intended behavior, implying potential non-termination when executed with certain external conditions.
