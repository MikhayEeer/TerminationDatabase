=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
When the initial a is negative, each recursive call decrements n further away from 0, so the base case n==0 is never reached and the recursion does not terminate.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
If a<0 then sum(a,b) calls itself with ever more negative n and never reaches the base case, leading to infinite recursion.
