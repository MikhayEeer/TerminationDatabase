NONTERM
[REASON]
The outer while(1) loop only breaks on an out-of-range input or when calculate_output calls exit(), but there exists a cycle in the finite state machine of (a17,a28,a11,a19,a25) under allowed inputs {1,3,4,5,6} that avoids any exit-branch. Hence the program can loop infinitely without terminating.

[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The main loop is `while(1)` reading nondeterministic inputs; for inputs in {1,3,4,5,6} it never breaks, so there exists an infinite execution.
