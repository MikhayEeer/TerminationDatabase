[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The value of `j` continuously increases with each iteration, thereby never allowing `i` to reach or exceed `j`, causing the loop to run indefinitely.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The variable `j` is incremented in every loop iteration, and since `i` is incremented at the same rate, the condition `i < j` will always hold true once entered. This makes the loop non-terminating.
