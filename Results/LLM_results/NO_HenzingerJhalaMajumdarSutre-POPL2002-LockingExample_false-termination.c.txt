=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
Both loops use a purely non-deterministic guard with no decreasing measure.  In particular, `do { … } while (__VERIFIER_nondet_int());` and the second `do`–`while(new != old)` with `new` increasing only under a non-deterministic branch admit infinite executions when the guards repeatedly return true.

[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The `do … while (new != old)` loop can on every iteration take the branch that increments `new`, so `new != old` forever and the loop never exits.
