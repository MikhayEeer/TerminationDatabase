TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
non-linear  
[RANKING FUNCTION]  
The ranking function for this program is `min(x, y)`.  

This function is non-linear but it effectively decreases on every loop iteration. When the program makes a choice and decrements either `x` or `y` based on the conditions provided, the minimum of `(x, y)` will decrease by at least one on each iteration, ensuring the termination of the loop when both variables become non-positive. This proves that the program will eventually terminate.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
0.5 * min(x, y)^1 + 0.5 * 1
