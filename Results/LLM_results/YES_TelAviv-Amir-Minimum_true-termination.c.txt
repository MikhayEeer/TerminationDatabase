# Region           | Ranking function
x ≤ y              | 1.0 * x + 0.0 * y + 0.0
x >  y             | 0.0 * x + 1.0 * y + 0.0

Explanation: In each loop iteration the chosen variable is assigned min(x,y)−1, so in either region the corresponding piecewise linear function strictly decreases by at least 1 and remains non‐negative while the loop guard x>0∧y>0 holds.
