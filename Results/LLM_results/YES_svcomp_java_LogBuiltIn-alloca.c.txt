[RESULT]
TERMINATE

linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
x

The program is terminating because the function `mlog` contains a loop that decrements `*x_ref` by dividing it by 2 in each iteration. This operation ensures that `*x_ref` decreases monotonically and will eventually become less than or equal to 1, at which point the loop terminates. The linear ranking function for this loop is `x`, since `x` initially represents the value of `*x_ref` and it decreases with each loop iteration until the condition `*x_ref > 1` is no longer satisfied.

[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
x -> x

Explanation: The function `mlog` repeatedly divides its input `x` by 2 until it is no longer greater than 1. Therefore, each iteration of the loop strictly decreases the integer value of `x`, ensuring that the loop must eventually terminate. The ranking function is linear with respect to the input value `x`.
