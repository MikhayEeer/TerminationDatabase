The program is terminating. It can be proved by the multi-phase ranking function on the variable `x`. The main loop decreases `x` by 1 in each iteration, and once `x` becomes negative, the loop terminates. The inner loop with `y` does not affect termination since it resets `y` to 1 and increases `y` until it is no longer less than `x`, which effectively causes it to terminate independently once `x` changes.

[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * x^1 + 0.0 * 1
1.0 * (x - y)^1 + 0.0 * 1

Explanation: 
The program will terminate as there exists a multi-phase ranking function that eventually decreases and leads to program termination.
- The first phase decreases the value of `x` with each iteration of the outer loop `while (x >= 0)`.
- The second phase, inside the inner loop `while (y < x)`, involves `y` increasing until it is no longer less than `x`. When the inner loop exits, the outer loop decrements `x`, ensuring eventual termination.
