[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 *  x^1  

The program is terminating, and the termination can be demonstrated using a multi-phase ranking function. The variable `x` is non-negative initially and is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the outer loop. This guarantees that `x` will eventually become negative, causing the loop to terminate. The ranking function `1.0 * x^1` decreases with each iteration of the loop, providing evidence of termination.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
Phase 1: 1.0 * (x + 1)  
Phase 2: 1.0 * (x - y + 1)  

The program is terminating because it has two phases where each phase has a separate ranking function that demonstrates a decrease. The first ranking function 1.0 * (x + 1) decreases as `x` decreases in the outer loop. The second ranking function 1.0 * (x - y + 1) decreases as `y` doubles and becomes greater than or equal to `x`, terminating the inner loop. This multi-phase ranking function ensures eventual termination of both loops.
