TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
old_x - 2*x

The program is terminating and can be proved by the linear ranking function `old_x - 2*x`. The loop will terminate because `x` is updated to a value such that `2*x <= old_x`, which decreases the ranking function and eventually exits the loop.

[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * x^1

This program is terminating, as the value of `x` is bounded and decreases unless the loop is exited due to the `break` statement when the condition `2*x > old_x` is met. The linear ranking function `1.0 * x` demonstrates this by providing a measure that is strictly decreasing in each loop iteration where the loop continues.
