=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
piecewise  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * x^1 + 0.0 * y^1  (when the first branch is taken where x = x - 1)  
1.0 * y^1 + 0.0 * x^1  (when the second branch is taken where y = y - 1)  

This program is terminating because, in each iteration of the loop, either `x` or `y` is decreased. If `x` is decreased, eventually it will reach zero, breaking the condition `x > 0`. If `y` is decreased, eventually it will reach zero, breaking the condition `y > 0`. Although the value of `x` may be reset to any non-deterministic value, the decrement of either `x` or `y` ensures progress towards termination.
