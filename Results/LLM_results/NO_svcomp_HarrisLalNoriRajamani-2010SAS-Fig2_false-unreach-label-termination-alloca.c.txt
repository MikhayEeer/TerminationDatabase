[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The loop step size *d can be 0 or negative (d∈{1,0,−1}) while *x is initially nondeterministically positive, yielding infinite or non‐decreasing loop iterations.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
*d can be 0 or negative while *x may be initialized >0, so in the loop “*x = *x - *d” does not decrease *x and the loop can run forever.
