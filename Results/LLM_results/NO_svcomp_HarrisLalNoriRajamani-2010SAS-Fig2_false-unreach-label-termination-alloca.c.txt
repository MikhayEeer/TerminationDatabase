=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program can be non-terminating if the pointer `x` is initialized to a value greater than 0 and then decremented by `*d` where `*d` is always set to 1. The nondeterministic updates to `*d` can result in an infinite loop as `*d` might always be 1 or 0, especially given the condition of decrementing `*d` at the start, which can create multiple scenarios where `*x` never reaches 0.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program can enter a non-terminating state if both `*d` becomes 0 and `*x` starts as a positive value. In this case, the while loop condition `*x > 0` will always be true but since `*d` is 0, `*x` will never decrease, causing an infinite loop. The initial nondeterministic assignments and decrements to `*d` may result in this scenario.
