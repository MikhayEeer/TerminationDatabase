[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
-1 * x^1 + 0.5 * 1

This program is terminating as the linear ranking function `-1 * x^1 + 0.5` shows. In the loop `while (*x > 0)`, the value of `*x` strictly decreases by `*d` which is either 0 or 1, meaning the loop will eventually terminate as long as `*x` is initially a positive number and `*d` is not zero. Since `*d` starts at 1 in the main function, and there are various conditions to potentially decrease it, it can never become negative, thus ensuring eventual termination as `*x` decreases in each iteration.
