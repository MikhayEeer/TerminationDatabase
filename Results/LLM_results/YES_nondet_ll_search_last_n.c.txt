1.0 * n + -1.0 * idx(curr)

Explanation:
We assign to each pointer‐state a virtual integer idx(curr) equal to the number of “next” links from the head to curr.  The loop guard is curr->value != n, which holds exactly while idx(curr) < n (since the unique node with value n sits at depth n – 1).  On each iteration curr moves one step forward, so idx(curr) increases by exactly 1 and the linear function

   f(n, idx) = n – idx(curr)

decreases by 1.  Since f is a non‐negative integer when the loop guard holds and strictly decreases on each iteration, the loop terminates.

[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi‐phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
Phase 1 (init_list loop): f₁(n,j) = 1.0 * n + (–1.0) * j  
Phase 2 (search loop): f₂(n,k) = 1.0 * n + (–1.0) * k  

Explanation of variables:  
– In init_list, j is the loop index (j runs 1,…,n–1), so f₁ decreases by n each iteration.  
– In search, k is the number of nodes visited so far (each loop iteration increments k by 1), so f₂ decreases by 1 each iteration.  
Since both phases are bounded below by 0 and strictly decrease on every iteration of their respective loops, the whole program terminates.
