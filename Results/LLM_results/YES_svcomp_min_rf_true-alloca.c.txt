f₁(x,y)=x    (when the then-branch “__VERIFIER_nondet_int() != 0” is taken)  
f₂(x,y)=y    (when the else-branch “__VERIFIER_nondet_int() == 0” is taken)  

Each piece strictly decreases on its respective transition:  
– In the then-branch x′ = min(x,y)−1 < x.  
– In the else-branch y′ = min(x,y)−1 < y.
