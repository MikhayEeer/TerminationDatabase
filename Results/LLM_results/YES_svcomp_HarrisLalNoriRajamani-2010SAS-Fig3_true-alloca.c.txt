[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * x^1

The program is terminating because in each iteration of the loop, the value of *x is decremented by the function foo(), and since the loop condition is *x > 0, eventually *x will become non-positive, causing the loop to terminate. The ranking function 1.0 * x^1 demonstrates a strictly decreasing behavior with each loop iteration when *x is positive.
