NONTERM
[REASON]
If one input is zero and the other positive (e.g. y1=0, y2=5), then in the loop y2 = y2 - y1 leaves y2 unchanged and y1<y2 forever, so the while‐loop never terminates.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
If one of y1,y2 is 0 and the other >0, the subtraction step leaves both unchanged (n–0=n), so the loop condition y1≠y2 holds forever and gcd never terminates.
