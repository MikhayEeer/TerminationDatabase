1.0 * (x - z)^1 + 0.0 * 1
1.0 * (y - z)^1 + 0.0 * 1

Explanation: 

The outer loop `while (x == y && x > z)` continues as long as both x equals y and x is greater than z. Within this loop, there is an inner loop `while (y > z)` that decrements both x and y simultaneously. 

1. For the inner loop, the ranking function is `(y - z)`, which is positive when `y > z` and decreases with every iteration since `y` is decremented. This ensures the inner loop terminates.

2. After exiting the inner loop, `x` will be equal to `z` (because `x` and `y` start equal and are decremented by the same amount), causing the condition `x == y` to not hold when trying to re-enter the outer loop. Thus, the outer loop eventually terminates after the termination of the inner loop.
