[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The Ackermann function is known for its non-primitive recursive nature, leading to potentially unbounded computations. Thus, depending on the inputs (`x`, `y`), it may not terminate. Specifically, for sufficiently large input values like `x = 4`, `y = 2`, the function will recurse deeply and may not terminate.
