[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The second loop (L2) may continue indefinitely. Specifically, if `*d_ref` is chosen as 2 and `*x > 0 && *y > 0`, and if the nondeterministic choices always cause `*y` to reset to a positive value or keep `*x` positive, the loop does not guarantee termination, as it can continuously enter P1, resetting `*y` and only partially affecting `*x`. The conditions for decrementing *x and *y may not consistently lead to termination in all nondeterministic cases.
