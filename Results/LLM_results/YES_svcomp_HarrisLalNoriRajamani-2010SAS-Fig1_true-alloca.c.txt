Explanation of the three‐component nested ranking function ⟨f₁,f₂,f₃⟩:

• f₁ = k – z strictly decreases in every L1 iteration (z doubles so k–z drops by at least 1) and once f₁≤0 loop L1 exits.  
• While f₁≤0 and execution is in L2, f₂ = x decreases by d (≥1) on every P1‐branch; in the other branch f₂ stays the same but f₃ = y decreases by d.  
• Hence in L2 the lexicographic pair ⟨f₂,f₃⟩ strictly decreases on every iteration, forcing termination.
