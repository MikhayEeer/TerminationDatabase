[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
0.5 * (|x - y|)  

Explanation:  
The program terminates because the difference between `x_ref` and `y_ref` decreases by 1 in every iteration of the loop. If `x_ref` is greater than `y_ref`, `y_ref` is incremented. If `x_ref` is less than or equal to `y_ref`, `x_ref` is incremented. In either case, the distance `|x_ref - y_ref|` decreases, acting as a strictly decreasing ranking function which eventually reaches zero, causing the loop to terminate.

[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
|x - y|

Explanation: The given program's while loop will terminate because the difference between `x_ref` and `y_ref` decreases by 1 on each iteration. When either `*x_ref` is incremented or `*y_ref` is incremented, the values move closer together until they are equal, thus causing the termination of the loop. This can be seen as a linear ranking function based on the absolute difference `|x - y|`, which strictly decreases in every iteration and ensures termination when the difference becomes zero.
