[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
|x_ref - y_ref|  

Explanation:  
The program terminates because in each iteration of the loop within `test_fun`, either `*x_ref` or `*y_ref` is incremented, thus decreasing the absolute difference between `*x_ref` and `*y_ref` by exactly 1 until they are equal. Once `*x_ref` equals `*y_ref`, the loop condition `!(*x_ref == *y_ref)` becomes false, causing the loop to terminate. Therefore, `|x_ref - y_ref|` serves as a linear ranking function demonstrating termination.
