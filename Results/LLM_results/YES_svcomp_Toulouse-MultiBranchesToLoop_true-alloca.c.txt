[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The value of `*x` can be randomly set to either 1 or -1, which affects the increments and decrements applied to it. This randomness means there is no clear direction or decrease in the overall loop control variables (*y and *z) towards termination. If *x is set to 1, *y increases and *z decreases, potentially causing the loop to never terminate if the conditions inside the while loop are never invalidated.
