[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
11 - i

The program is terminating because the variable `i` increments by 1 in each iteration of the loop, and once `i` exceeds 10, the loop breaks, guaranteeing termination. The linear ranking function `11 - i` shows that as `i` increases, the value of this function decreases, leading to eventual termination.
