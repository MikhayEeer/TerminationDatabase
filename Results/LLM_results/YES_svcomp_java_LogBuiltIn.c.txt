mlog(x) = x - 1

The function `mlog` divides `x` by 2 in each iteration, so the value of `x` decreases exponentially, ensuring that the loop will terminate. The ranking function `mlog(x) = x - 1` demonstrates that with each iteration, the value decreases and eventually becomes less than or equal to 1, which causes the loop to terminate.

1.0 *  x^1 + 0.0 * 1

The function `mlog` repeatedly divides `x` by 2 until `x` is no longer greater than 1. The value of `x` strictly decreases, and since the decrements are towards zero, the process will terminate. The ranking function `1.0 * x^1` shows that as `x` decreases, the value approaches termination.
