When \( f(x) \) or \( g(x) \) is called with positive \( x \), they make recursive calls with strictly smaller arguments, ultimately reaching arguments less than or equal to zero where they terminate.  
1. For \( f(x) \): if \( x > 0 \), it calls \( g(x) + g(x+1) \) reducing the problem to smaller arguments.  
2. For \( g(x) \): if \( x > 0 \), it calls \( f(x-1) + f(x-2) \) further reducing the argument size.

The mutually recursive calls ensure that each path in the recursion decreases the problem size, leading to termination when \( x \) reaches 0 or a negative value.

For `f(x)`:
1. When `x > 0`, ranking function: `x`
2. When `x <= 0`, ranking function: `0`

For `g(x)`:
1. When `x > 0`, ranking function: `x`
2. When `x <= 0`, ranking function: `0`

The program involves mutually recursive functions `f` and `g`. Both functions have branch conditions based on `x` and call each other in a manner that decreases `x`. When `x` is non-positive, both functions return immediately. Hence, the initial value of `x` is steadily decreased until it becomes non-positive, ensuring termination. The piecewise ranking function above captures the decrease in `x`.
