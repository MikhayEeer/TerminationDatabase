=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * y^1 + 0.0 * x^1  
0.5 * x^1 + 0.0 * 1  

This program terminates as it has a multi-phase ranking function. In the first phase, the value of `y` strictly decreases when `x` is positive and `y` is decreased directly in one of the branches. In the second phase, for negative `x`, the value of `x` either increases towards zero in one branch or keeps decreasing as `y` is decreased in the nested condition. Thus, the program is guaranteed to terminate.
