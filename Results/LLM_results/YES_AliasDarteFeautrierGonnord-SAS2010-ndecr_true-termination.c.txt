[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * i^1 + 0.0  

The program is terminating because the value of `i` is strictly decreasing by 1 in every iteration of the loop, starting from `n - 1` and going down to 1. This linear ranking function demonstrates a well-founded order towards termination.
