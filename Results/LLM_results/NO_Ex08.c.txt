[REASON]
For any positive initial i, once i decrements to 1, up is set to 1 so i increments up to 10, where up is reset to 0 and i decrements back to 1, repeating infinitely.

=== Response 2 ===

NONTERM
[REASON]
For any initial i>0, once i reaches 1 you set up=1 and increment i up to 10, then set up=0 and decrement back to 1, cycling forever without reaching 0.
