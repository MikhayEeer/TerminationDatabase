=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTION]
x - y - 1

The program terminates because the value of `x - y - 1` decreases by 1 during each iteration of the loop, while it remains non-negative. Once `x - y - 1` is zero or negative, the loop condition `x >= y + 1` becomes false, and the loop terminates.
