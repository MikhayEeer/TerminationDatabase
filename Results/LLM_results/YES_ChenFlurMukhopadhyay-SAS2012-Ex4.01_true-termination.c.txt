Phase 1: \( n - x \)  
Phase 2: \(-1\)  

Explanation: 

1. **Phase 1:** The primary ranking function is \( n - x \). Each iteration essentially attempts to increment \( x \) by a more than linear factor (since \( x = 2*x + y \)), which will eventually cause the condition \( x > n \) to break, especially since \( x \) is always updated to be larger each time as long as it remains less than or equal to \( n \).

2. **Phase 2:** This phase deals with situations when the transition condition is already violated, essentially serving as a constant phase, confirming termination once the first phase is complete and not re-enterable.

TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1. Phase 1:  `x + y`   
   - The value of `x + y` decreases in each iteration of the loop due to the update `x = 2*x + y`. 
   
2. Phase 2:  `n - x`   
   - This phase triggers the loop termination as the condition `x <= n` will eventually become false when the value of `n - x` is no longer positive.

The given program is multi-phase terminating due to these ranking functions.
