First phase:  
0.5 * (n - x)^1  
Second phase:  
-decreasing ranks due to non-linear transformations as combined increases in `x` and `y` given constraints will eventually violate `x + y >= 0` as `z` ensures increases. 

This demonstrates that although the relation is non-linear, the program will eventually terminate due to constraints breaking.

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
The non-linear nature and structure of the loop imply a decrease in the composite expression `x - n/2` on each iteration, which ensures termination as `x` becomes larger than `n`. As `x` increases exponentially based on the operation `x = 2*x + y`, while `x <= n` initially, eventually `x` surpasses `n`, causing the loop condition `x <= n` to fail, thus terminating the loop. This non-linearly structured ranking function effectively demonstrates the termination of the program.
