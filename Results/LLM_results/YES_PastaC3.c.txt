[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
nested  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * (y - x)^1  
1.0 * (z - x)^1  

The program is terminating because the value of (y - x) decreases with every iteration of the loop when `x < z`. Also, the value of (z - x) decreases when `x >= z`. This indicates that each execution path of the loop results in strictly decreasing values of these ranking functions, and hence guarantees termination.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
piecewise  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * (y - x) + 0.0 * 1 (when x < z)  
1.0 * (y - z) + 0.0 * 1 (when x >= z)  

The program is terminating because in each iteration of the loop, either the value of `x` is increased (when `x < z`) or the value of `z` is increased (when `x >= z`). As `x` increases and approaches `y`, the difference `(y - x)` decreases, serving as a ranking function; meanwhile, when `x >= z`, the difference `(y - z)` decreases. These decreases guarantee that the loop will eventually terminate.
