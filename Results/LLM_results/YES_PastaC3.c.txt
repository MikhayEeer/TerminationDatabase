[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
y - x   
  
The program is terminating because in each iteration of the loop, the value of `x` is incremented by 1. This reduces the value of `y - x` by 1, making it an appropriate linear ranking function. Once `x` is no longer less than `y`, the loop terminates.
