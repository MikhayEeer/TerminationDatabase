if x < z then f(x,y,z) = y − x  
else f(x,y,z) = y − z + 1  

Explanation of decrease by 1 each loop‐iteration:

• Case x<z: x→x+1, so f_new = y−(x+1) = (y−x)−1 = f_old−1.  
• Case x≥z and x>z: z→z+1, so f_new = y−(z+1)+1 = (y−z+1)−1 = f_old−1.  
• Case x=z: z→z+1 puts us into the x<z branch next, so f_new = y−x = y−z = (y−z+1)−1 = f_old−1.  

Moreover, for all states with x<y we have f(x,y,z)>0, so f is a well‐founded ranking.
