1.0 * len₁ + -1.0 * (p₁ – p₁₀)

Explanation:
• We model in cstrcmp a single loop over s1 (and s2) advancing from an initial pointer p₁₀ up to the terminating '\0' located at p₁₀ + len₁ – 1.  
• Let p₁ be the current pointer into s1 and len₁ the (constant) allocated length of that string.  
• Define the ranking function R = len₁ – (p₁ – p₁₀).  
  – Initially p₁ = p₁₀, so R = len₁ > 0.  
  – Each loop iteration increments p₁ by 1, so R decreases by exactly 1.  
  – When p₁ reaches p₁₀ + (len₁ – 1), *(p₁) == '\0' and the loop exits.  
Thus R is a linear function over the program variables that is always non‐negative and strictly decreases on each iteration, proving termination.

TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * len1 + 1.0 * len2 + (-1.0) * off1 + (-1.0) * off2

Where  
• len1 is the length of the first string (a constant ≥1),  
• len2 is the length of the second string (a constant ≥1),  
• off1 is the current index into the first string (initially 0, incremented by 1 each loop),  
• off2 is the current index into the second string (initially 0, incremented by 1 each loop).  

This ranking function starts at R = len1 + len2 and decreases by 2 on every iteration of the strcmp loop, and the loop exits when either off1 = len1 or off2 = len2 (i.e. when R ≤ 0).
