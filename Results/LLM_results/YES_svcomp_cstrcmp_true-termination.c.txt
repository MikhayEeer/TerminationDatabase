The function `cstrcmp` operates in a single while loop which processes each character of the input strings exactly once. The loop terminates when it finds a differing character or reaches the end of either string. Therefore, a suitable linear ranking function can be constructed based on the position of the pointers `s1` and `s2` in the strings. As each loop iteration strictly moves one step forward in aligning them, the loop progresses towards termination in linear time relative to the minimum of the lengths of the two strings involved.

The program will terminate as it compares two null-terminated strings using the `cstrcmp` function. 

The `cstrcmp` function operates in the following manner:
1. It iterates over both strings, character by character, until it finds characters that differ or it reaches the end of one of the strings.
2. Since the strings are guaranteed to be null-terminated by the `__VERIFIER_nondet_String` function, the loop will end once a null character (`'\0'`) is encountered in either string.

This implies that no infinite looping can occur as the loop condition (`*s1 != '\0' && *s1 == *s2`) will eventually become false when at least one of the strings ends, ensuring that the program terminates.
