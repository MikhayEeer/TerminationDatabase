The program terminates because each 'while' loop has a well-defined decreasing counter eventually leading to termination: 
- The outermost 'while' loop decreases with the increment of `i` towards 100.
- The nested loops reduce their respective counters (`j < a`, `k >= 0`, `l < b`) based on the values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `l`. 
All these results show that these loops will eventually reach their termination conditions.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The innermost loop controlled by variable `m` is infinite. The loop condition `while (m >= 0)` always holds since `m` is decremented by `0`, making no progress towards termination.
