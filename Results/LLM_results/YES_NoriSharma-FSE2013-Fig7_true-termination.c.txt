max( M - i,  N - j )  
 
Explanation: On each loop iteration i and j both increase by 1, so M-i and N-j each decrease by 1, hence their maximum is a well-founded piecewise linear ranking function.

– f₁(i,j) = M – i  
– f₂(i,j) = N – j  

(The loop-guard (i<M ∨ j<N) ensures max(f₁,f₂)>0 on entry, and each iteration decrements both f₁ and f₂ by exactly 1, hence max(f₁,f₂) is a well-founded ranking function.)
