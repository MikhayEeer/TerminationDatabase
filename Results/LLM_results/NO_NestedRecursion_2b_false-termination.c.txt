For any x≥1, g(1) calls g(2), g(2) calls g(1) in turn, creating an infinite mutual recursion that never reaches the base case.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
For any x>0, g(x) calls g(x–1) to compute y=g(x–1), then calls g(y+1) with y≥1, so the argument never strictly decreases to 0 and recursion never bottoms out.
