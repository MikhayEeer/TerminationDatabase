recursion depth within function calls in `g(x)` decreases eventually to the base case, `g(0)`.

The function `g` is recursive and contains nested calls to itself. The recursive calls are structured to decrease the argument in a way that ensures termination. The key insight is that each call to `g(x)` entails evaluating `g(x - 1) + 1`, leading to eventual base case satisfaction. The termination can be reasoned by observing that each call with `x > 0` further breaks down into subsequent calls with smaller values, eventually reaching `g(0)`, which returns 1, thereby unwinding the call stack successfully.

The evaluation evaluates down a hierarchy of recursive calls until the non-recursion condition `x == 0` is met, making it a nested ranking scenario where the termination is ensured through recursive descent to the base case.
