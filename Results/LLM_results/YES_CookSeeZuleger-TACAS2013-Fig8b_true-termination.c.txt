1.0 * x^1 + -1.0 * M^1 + 0.0
1.0 * M^1 + -1.0 * x^1 + 0.0

Explanation of phases:
– Phase 1 is active when x > M (f₁(x,M)=x–M>0). In that case the update x:=0 yields f₁′=0–M < f₁, so the first phase strictly decreases and then drops to f₁′≤0.  
– Once x ≤ M, Phase 1 is no longer positive and Phase 2 takes over with f₂(x,M)=M–x>0. Each x<x<M iteration does x:=x+1 so f₂ decreases by 1, and when x=M the loop exits.
