=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
piecewise
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * y1 + 1.0 * y2 if y1 > y2
1.0 * y2 + 1.0 * y1 if y2 >= y1

The program is guaranteed to terminate for all positive integer inputs to `gcd`. The `gcd` function consistently reduces the values of `y1` and `y2` by subtracting the smaller from the larger until they are equal. This ensures that each iteration decreases the combined value of `y1 + y2`.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * y1^1 + 1.0 * y2^1
