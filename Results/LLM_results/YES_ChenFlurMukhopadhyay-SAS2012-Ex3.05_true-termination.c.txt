Phase 1:  
\( f(x, y, z) = z - x \)  

In this program, initially \( x \) is bounded by \( z \) (i.e., \( x \leq z \)). The variable \( x \) is updated in such a way that it grows exponentially because it is doubled and added to a positive incrementing variable \( y \). Eventually, this update leads \( x \) to exceed \( z \), causing the loop condition \( x \leq z \) to become false, thus terminating the loop. The ranking function \( z - x \) decreases in some loosely correlated steps, and once \( x \) surpasses \( z \), the loop exits, proving eventual termination.
