=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * x^1 + 0.0 * y^1 + 0.0 * 1

Explanation: On each iteration x decreases by y (which is at least 23), so f(x,y)=x is a non‐negative integer that strictly decreases and thus proves termination.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * x^1 + 0.0 * y^1 + 0.0 * 1

Explanation:
The loop guard is x ≥ 0. Define the linear ranking function f(x,y)=x. On each iteration,
  x′ = x – y,  y′ = y + 1,
so f′ – f = (x – y) – x = –y ≤ –23 < 0.
Since initially x ≥ 0 in the loop and f decreases by at least 23 each step, the loop must terminate.
