[RANKING FUNCTION]  
f(x, y) = x - (y * (y - 1) / 2)  

Explanation:  
The program uses a decreasing linear ranking function \( f(x, y) = x - (y * (y - 1) / 2) \). Initially, \( x \) is an arbitrary integer, and \( y \) starts at 23. In each loop iteration, the value of \( f(x, y) \) decreases because \( x \) decreases by \( y \) and \( y \) increases by 1. The term \( (y * (y - 1) / 2) \) represents the cumulative increment due to the increasing value of \( y \), which ensures that \( f(x, y) \) eventually becomes negative, proving termination of the loop.
