[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  

[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear  

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
f(x, y) = x + 1  

Explanation: The program will terminate because the value of `x` decreases by `y` in each iteration of the loop, and `y` is increasing, ensuring that `x` will eventually become negative, causing the loop to exit. The linear ranking function `f(x, y) = x + 1` is positive when the loop is executing and becomes non-positive when the loop terminates.

[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
f(x, y) = x + y^2^(23)  

Explanation:  
The ranking function `f(x, y) = x + y^2^(23)` serves as a linear ranking function for the given program. Initially, `x` is any non-negative integer, and `y` is set to 23, decreasing the value of `x` iteratively by `y`, which increases with each iteration. The expression `x + y^2^(23)` is constructed such that it decreases with each iteration of the loop. Each time the loop executes, the decrement in `x` is more significant than the increment in the value added by `y^2^(23)`, ensuring that the overall value of the ranking function decreases monotonically and eventually terminates the loop.
