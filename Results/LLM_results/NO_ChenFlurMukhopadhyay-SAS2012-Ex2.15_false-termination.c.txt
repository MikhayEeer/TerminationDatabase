=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
If `x > 0` and `y >= 0`, the value of x will never decrease within the loop. Thus, the loop can continue indefinitely.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
If \( x > 0 \) and \( y \geq 0 \), then \( x \) will keep increasing in each iteration, causing the loop to run indefinitely.
