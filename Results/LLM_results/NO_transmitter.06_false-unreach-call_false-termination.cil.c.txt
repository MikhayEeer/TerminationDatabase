[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The main scheduling loop’s eval() uses a nondeterministic choice to run each runnable thread. If __VERIFIER_nondet_int() repeatedly returns false, no thread ever executes and the inner while(exists_runnable_thread()) loop never exits, yielding an infinite loop.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The main scheduler loop in start_simulation never terminates: after draining all runnable threads, time‐events are fired and threads reactivated, so exists_runnable_thread remains true and the while(1) loop runs forever.
