=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear  
[RANKING FUNCTION]  
x  

Explanation:  
The program terminates because the variable `x` is decremented in each iteration of the loop, either from the `foo()` function when the nondeterministic condition inside the loop is true or false. Since `x` is only decremented and the loop condition is `x > 0`, the variable `x` will eventually become non-positive, causing the loop to terminate.
