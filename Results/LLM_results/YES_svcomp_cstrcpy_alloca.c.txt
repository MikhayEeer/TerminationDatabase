The function `cstrcpy` in the given program will terminate as the loop iterates over the second string `s2` (or `src`), which is `nondetString` in `main`, until it encounters the null character `'\0'`. The string `nondetString` is guaranteed to have a null terminator at `length2-1`, and hence the loop will terminate after copying this null character.

linear  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
length2^1  

Explanation: This program terminates because the `while` loop within the `cstrcpy` function uses a ranking function that decrements the null-terminating character in the source string `nondetString` until it reaches `null` (represented by `'\0'`). Since `nondetString` always has a null-terminating character, the loop will decrement to zero, ensuring termination.
