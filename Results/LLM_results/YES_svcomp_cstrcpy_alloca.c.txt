[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * length2 + 1.0 * s2 + -1.0 * src

This ranking function φ = length2 + s2 – src is initially non‐negative (since src = s2 at loop entry) and decreases by exactly 1 on each iteration (as src increments), proving the copy loop terminates.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * length2^1 + 1.0 * s2^1 + -1.0 * src^1

Explanation: In the loop  
    while ((*dst++ = *src++) != '\0') ;  
each iteration increments the pointer src by 1, so the affine function  
    f = length2 + s2 – src  
strictly decreases by 1 on every loop iteration and is bounded below by 0 (since the string is null‐terminated within length2 bytes), which proves termination.
