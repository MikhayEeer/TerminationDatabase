=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
If i ≥ 5 or i ≤ –5, none of the branches in the loop body fire, so i remains unchanged and the loop runs infinitely.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
If the nondeterministic initial i ≥ 5 or i ≤ –5, the loop body makes no updates and i remains nonzero forever, so the loop never terminates.
