=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
piecewise
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
For i < 0: -i
For i > 0: i

The program will terminate because the value of `i` approaches zero in each iteration when within the bounds of -5 and 5. The ranking functions -i and i are strictly decreasing for i < 0 and i > 0 respectively, ensuring termination.
