=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
If y≤0 and x≥0 then each iteration x := x−y makes x non-decreasing and the guard x≥0 stays true, so the loop never terminates.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
When y<1 (i.e. y≤0), each iteration does x := x−y≥x, so if x≥0 the guard x>=0 stays true forever and the loop never terminates.
