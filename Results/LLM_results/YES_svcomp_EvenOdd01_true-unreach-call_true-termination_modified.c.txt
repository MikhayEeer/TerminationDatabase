n

The program is terminating. The main function calls `isOdd(n)` with a non-negative integer `n`. The recursion in `isOdd` and `isEven` each decrease `n` by 1 until it reaches 0 or 1, which are the base cases. Since `n` is non-negative and strictly decreases towards these base cases, the recursion will always terminate. The linear ranking function `n` demonstrates that `n` is decreased with each recursive call until termination.

1. f(n) = n  
2. f(n) = n - 1   

The program is recursive in nature and terminates as the recursion decreases the value of `n` by 1 in each call, ensuring eventual termination. The base case is reached when `n` is 0 or 1, and both these cases are handled explicitly to stop recursion. Therefore, the main function will terminate as well.
