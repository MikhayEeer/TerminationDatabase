n when calling isOdd  
n when calling isEven  

The program is terminating. It can be explained by a nested ranking function considering the mutual recursion between `isOdd` and `isEven`. Each call to these functions decreases `n` until it eventually reaches a base case (`n == 0` or `n == 1`).

[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
recursive
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
The functions `isOdd` and `isEven` recursively decrement the input `n` by 1 in each call, and when `n` is zero, they stop calling each other, creating a base case that leads directly to termination.
