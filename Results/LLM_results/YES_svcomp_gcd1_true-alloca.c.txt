=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  

[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
Phase 1: 1 * |y_ref|  

- The inner loop computes the modulus `r = x % y` by repeatedly subtracting `y` from `x`, which is bounded and terminates as `r` becomes less than `y`.  
- The outer loop is the Euclidean algorithm that repeatedly reduces `y_ref` until it becomes zero, which also terminates as it strictly decreases with each loop iteration.
