1. Phase 1: The outer loop of the `do-while` loop in `cstrncmp` depends on the value of `n`. It decreases with each iteration, and the loop terminates when `n` reaches 0. The ranking function for this phase is: `n` (linearly decreases to zero).  
2. Phase 2: Within the `do-while` loop:  
   - The return statements in the loop terminate it immediately when conditions are met (`*s1 != *s2++` or `*s1++ == 0`).  
   - No infinite cycles occur due to preconditions and the structure of the function, ensuring the loop body is eventually exited.  

Overall, the program terminates as the nested loops conclude within finite time limits dictated by the initial parameters and exit conditions.

n

The program calls the `cstrncmp` function with two strings `s1`, `s2`, and a nondeterministic integer `n`. The `cstrncmp` function compares the strings for a maximum of `n` characters. The loop in `cstrncmp` decrements `n` with each iteration. Since `n` is a nondeterministic integer, it will eventually reach zero or a character mismatch will occur, causing the loop to exit. Therefore, the program is terminating with a ranking function based on `n`.
