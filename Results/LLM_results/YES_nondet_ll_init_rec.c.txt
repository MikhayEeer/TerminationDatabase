The program's termination can be reasoned as follows: The function `init_list` is called with a parameter `n`, and each recursive call decrements `n` by 1. When `n` reaches 0, the recursion stops and the function returns `NULL`. Therefore, the program terminates because the recursive calls are bounded by `n`, a nondeterministic but finite integer, which serves as a linear ranking function.

The program is terminating. The `main` function initializes a linked list with a length determined by `n`, and since `n` must be non-negative for the list to be created, the recursive function `init_list` will eventually terminate when `n` reaches zero. Thus, `n` acts as a ranking function here, showing a strictly decreasing path to reach termination.
