=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
0.5 * x^1 + 0.5 * y^1 + -1.0 * z^1

Explanation: In the loop we have x>z and y>z, so f = (x+y)/2 – z ≥1 and on each iteration x and y are each decremented by 1, so f decreases by exactly 1 and remains non‐negative until the loop exits. This single linear ranking function proves termination.
