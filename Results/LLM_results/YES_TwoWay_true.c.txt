[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The recursive call in the function `twoWay` with arguments `(terminate, m)` where `m` can either increment or decrement based on a nondeterministic boolean (`terminate`) allows for a potential infinite positive increment when `terminate` is `false`. This leads to non-termination as the recursion can effectively keep increasing the value of `m` and therefore never hit the base case where `n < 0`.
