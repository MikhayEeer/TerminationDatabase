linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
10 - i 

The program is guaranteed to terminate as the `while` loop iterates a fixed number of times, specifically `N` times where `N` is initialized to 10. The loop variable `i` increments by 1 in each iteration and when `i` equals `N`, the loop terminates. Hence, a linear ranking function based on `i` is sufficient to prove termination.
