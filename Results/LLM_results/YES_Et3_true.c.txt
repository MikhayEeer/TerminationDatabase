=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The value of `a` can increase indefinitely due to `a = a + b` when `b` remains non-positive, preventing termination.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The values of \( a \) and \( b \) can be adjusted such that \( a \) remains positive indefinitely due to the addition of \( b \) to \( a \), even as \( b \) decreases. This creates conditions where the recursion can continue forever without reaching a termination condition.
