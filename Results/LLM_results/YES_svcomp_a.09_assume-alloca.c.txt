=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * x^1 + -1.0 * z^1 + 0.0 * 1  

Explanation: In the loop we have y>0 and each iteration does z := z+y, so f(x,z)=x−z is non‐negative on entry and strictly decreases by y>0 each step, proving termination.
