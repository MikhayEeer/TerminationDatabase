-1.0 *  (*x_ref)^1 + 1.0 *  (*z_ref)^1

Explanation: The program iterates within the while loop only while `*x_ref >= *z_ref`. In each iteration, `*z_ref` is increased by `*y_ref` (which is assumed positive due to the condition `*y_ref > 0` before entering the while loop). Therefore, `*z_ref` strictly increases while `*x_ref` remains constant, making `*x_ref - *z_ref` decrease in each iteration, ensuring termination of the loop when `*z_ref` becomes greater than `*x_ref`.

TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
y - (z - x)

The program is terminating as the value `y - (z - x)` decreases with each iteration of the loop, thus ensuring the termination of the loop. Here, `y` is initially checked if it is less than or equal to zero, and if so, the execution path bypasses the loop. If the loop executes, the increment of `z` by `y` eventually makes `x` no longer greater than or equal to `z`, terminating the loop.
