The program's termination can be demonstrated through a multi-phase ranking function. The outer loop, driven by the condition `*x_ref >= 0`, is decrementing `*x_ref` by 1 in each iteration, ensuring progress towards termination. Within the inner loop controlled by `*x_ref > *y_ref`, `*y_ref` is being doubled until the condition is no longer satisfied. Therefore, both the inner and outer loops are guaranteed to eventually terminate.

[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
nested
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
Outer loop: *x_ref
Inner loop: *x_ref - *y_ref

Explanation: 

1. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop executes while `*x_ref >= 0`. Inside the loop, `*x_ref` decreases by 1 in each iteration with the statement `*x_ref = *x_ref - 1;`. This change makes the outer loop terminate because `*x_ref` eventually drops below 0, giving a clear integer linear descent towards termination.

2. **Inner Loop**: The inner loop executes while `*x_ref > *y_ref`. It doubles the value of `*y_ref` with each iteration: `*y_ref = 2*(*y_ref);`. Since `*y_ref` starts at 1 and doubles, it will eventually exceed `*x_ref`, at which point the inner loop will stop. The inner loop ranking function is `*x_ref - *y_ref`, which strictly decreases since `*y_ref` increases significantly faster than `*x_ref` decreases.

The combination of these two ranking functions ensures that the program is terminating.
