[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * (|i| - |w|) if |i| > |w|  
0 otherwise  

The program terminates as every iteration of the loop reduces the absolute value of `i` when `|i| > w`, until `|i|` is not greater than `w` anymore, at which point `i` is set to 0, causing the loop to terminate. This is effectively captured by the piecewise ranking function above.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
piecewise
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
(i < -5): -i^1 -1
(i > 5): i^1 +1
Otherwise: 0

This program is terminating because the value of `i` is continually adjusted to move towards zero, finally reaching zero and exiting the while loop. The ranking function is defined piecewise, depending on the range in which `i` falls.
