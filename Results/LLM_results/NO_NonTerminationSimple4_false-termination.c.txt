=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program does not terminate for `y >= 5` because the loop `while (x >= 0)` continues indefinitely since `x` remains non-negative and `y` decreases continuously without any condition altering `x` or allowing the loop to terminate.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program does not terminate for y >= 5, as the while loop condition `x >= 0` is not affected by any change in the loop, making no progress towards termination. The value of `y` decreases but it does not influence the termination of the loop.
