For any input with y ≥ 5 and x ≥ 0, the loop `while(x>=0)` never updates x, so it runs forever.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
In the loop `while (x >= 0) y--;`, x is never modified. Thus for any initial state with y ≥ 5 (so the `if` is bypassed) and x ≥ 0, the condition `x >= 0` remains true forever, yielding a non-terminating execution.
