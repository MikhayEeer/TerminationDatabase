multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * (n - i)^1  
1.0 * (i + 1 - j)^1  

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
nested
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
n - i, i - j

This states that the outer loop uses `n - i` and the inner loop uses `i - j` as ranking functions. In each iteration of the outer loop, `i` increases, and in each iteration of the inner loop, `j` increases until it exceeds `i`. As a result, both ranking functions strictly decrease, demonstrating program termination.
