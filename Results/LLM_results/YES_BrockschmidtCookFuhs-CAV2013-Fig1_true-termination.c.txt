1.0 * n^1 - 1.0 * i^1  
1.0 * i^1 + 0.0 * 1 - 1.0 * j^1  

The program consists of a nested loop structure. The outer loop increments `i` until it is no longer less than `n`. Within each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop increments `j` until it is greater than `i`. The ranking function for the outer loop (`n - i`) shows a decrease towards 0 as `i` increases towards `n`. The inner loop ranking function (`i - j`) decreases as `j` increments beyond `i`. Thus, both loops demonstrate a decrease in these functions within every respective iteration, thereby proving termination.
