1.0 * y + 1.0 * z + -99.0
1.0 * x + 1.0

Explanation of the multi‐phase ranking argument:

– Phase 1 (f₁): f₁(y,z) = y + z − 99  
  • In any loop state with z=1 and y=100, f₁=2>0, and in the next state y→99, z→−1 so f₁′=99−1−99=−1<2, thus f₁ strictly decreases to ≤0.  
  • Once f₁≤0, we move on to phase 2.  

– Phase 2 (f₂): f₂(x) = x + 1  
  • Whenever the loop continues with x′=x−y≥0 one has x≥y≥99, so x′+1=(x+1)−y< x+1 and x′+1>0.  
  • Thus f₂ strictly decreases on every remaining iteration until x<0 and the loop exits.

[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * x + -1.0 * z + 1.0

This function is always non‐negative on the loop (since x≥0 ⇒ x−z+1 ≥0) and in each iteration
Δf = (x−y) − (−z) + 1  − (x−z+1) = −y + 2z ≤ −99 +2 < 0,
so it strictly decreases and proves termination.
