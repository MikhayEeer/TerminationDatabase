TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * (x - y) + 0.0 * c

Explanation: The program has a while loop that executes as long as `x > y`. In each iteration, `x` is decreased by 1, which means that `x - y` will eventually reach zero or a negative value, causing the loop to terminate. Thus, the program is terminating. A linear ranking function can be characterized by `x - y`, which strictly decreases by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
