=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * length1^1  
1.0 * length2^1  

The program's termination can be proved using a multi-phase ranking function. The outer loop over `sc1` in `cstrpbrk` decrements a bound given by `length1`. The inner while loop iterates over `s2`, bounded by `length2`. Both phases are strictly decreasing and thus ensure that the function terminates.
