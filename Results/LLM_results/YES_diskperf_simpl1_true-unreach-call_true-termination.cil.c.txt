[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * deviceExtension__Processors + -1.0 * i

Explanation:
The only unbounded loop in the program is in DiskPerfDeviceControl:
  while (i < deviceExtension__Processors) { i++; }
A valid linear ranking function for this loop is f(i,deviceExtension__Processors) = deviceExtension__Processors − i, which is non‐negative when the loop guard holds and strictly decreases by 1 on each iteration, ensuring termination.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
f₁ = deviceExtension__Processors - i

Explanation:  
The only loop in the program is in DiskPerfDeviceControl:

    i = 0;
    while (i < deviceExtension__Processors) {
      i++;
    }

A valid linear ranking function for that loop is f₁ = deviceExtension__Processors − i, which is non‐negative on entry and strictly decreases by 1 on each iteration, thus proving termination. All other control flows contain no unbounded loops or recursion.
