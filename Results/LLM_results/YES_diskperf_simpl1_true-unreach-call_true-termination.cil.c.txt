[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program contains loops and recursive calls where the conditions and internal nondeterministic choices make it possible for the program to run indefinitely. The program's structure, with nondeterministic function calls that can modify its state in unpredictable ways, leads to scenarios where the program can continue executing without reaching a termination point.
