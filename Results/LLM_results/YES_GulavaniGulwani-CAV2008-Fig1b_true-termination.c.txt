[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * n - 1.0 * x^1  
1.0 * m - 1.0 * x^1  

Explanation:  
The program consists of two separate `while` loops. The first loop runs while `x < n` and increments `x` by 1 in each iteration. Thus, the difference `n - x` serves as a valid ranking function for this loop, because it is strictly decreasing with each iteration and must eventually reach zero or fewer, terminating the loop.  

Similarly, the second loop runs while `x < m` and also increments `x` by 1, so `m - x` is a valid ranking function for this loop. Both loops have linear ranking functions, and the loops are executed sequentially, making the entire program terminating.

[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * n + 0.0 *  m^0 + 0.0 * 1
1.0 * m + 0.0 * 1 + 0.0 * 1

Explanation: The program consists of two while loops. In the first loop, `x` is incremented until it reaches `n`, and in the second loop, `x` is incremented until it reaches `m`. Since both `n` and `m` are constants, the progress of `x` ensures both loops will eventually terminate. Thus, the program is terminating.
