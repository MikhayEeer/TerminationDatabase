=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
There is a non‐terminating run for x=0, y=0 since each iteration maps (x,y)=(0,0)→(0,0), so the loop never exits.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
Starting from x=0, y=0 the update (x,y)→(x−y,x+y) leaves (0,0) unchanged, so x<5 forever and the loop never terminates.
