=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program is non-terminating for initial values x = 0 and y = 0. In this case, the updates result in x and y remaining at 0, causing an infinite loop since the condition x < 5 is never violated.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The values of \( x \) and \( y \) can enter a cycle for certain initial values (e.g., \( x = 0, y = 0 \)) where the changes in \( x \) and \( y \) keep \( x \) less than 5, causing an infinite loop.
