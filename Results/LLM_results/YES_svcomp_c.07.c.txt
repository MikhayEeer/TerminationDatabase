The program terminates because the loop condition relies on two constraints, `i <= 100` and `j <= k`. The value of `k` decreases in each iteration (`k = k - 1`) while `i` and `j` are manipulated such that the loops approach termination. As `k` decreases and `j` increases, eventually `j` will exceed `k`, causing the loop to terminate. The ranking function for the multi-phase termination shows how `k` decreases until it invalidates the loop condition.
