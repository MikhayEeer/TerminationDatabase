The function `rec1` has a nested ranking function based on the decreasing of its argument `i` in each recursive call. Specifically, the argument decreases in the following way: `i -> i-2 -> i-3 -> i-4 ...` until `i <= 0`, which indicates termination of the recursion.  
The function `rec2` consists of a call to `rec1`, and because `rec1` is terminating for non-negative `j`, `rec2` will terminate whenever its argument eventually leads to a non-negative value passed to `rec1`. Therefore, `x` in `main()` ensures the termination of `rec1`, and consequently, the termination behavior of the program is determined and terminating.

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
The recursive function `rec1` is terminating because it continually reduces the value `i` with each recursive call until `i` is non-positive, at which point the recursion ends. The `rec1` function has a nested invariant that decreases the value of `i` through a triple recursive call, ensuring termination. The same reasoning applies to `rec2`, although it is not invoked in `main`. As `main` invokes only `rec1`, the overall program is terminating.
