Explanation of the ranking argument:
For any call rec1(i) with i>0, each recursive sub‐call is made on an argument k strictly smaller than i:
  • First sub‐call: k₁ = i−2 < i.
  • Second: k₂ = rec1(i−2)−1 ≤ 1−1 = 0 < i.
  • Third: k₃ = rec1(k₂) ≤ 1 < i.
Since k < i in all cases and rec1(·) returns immediately when its argument is ≤0, the linear measure R(i)=i is a well‐founded ranking function, proving termination.
