Phase 1: f₁(x,y) = y + 1  
Phase 2: f₂(x,y) = x + 1

Explanation:
• While y ≥ 0 (Phase 1) each iteration y↦y–1 so f₁ decreases by 1 and is always ≥0.  
• Once y<0 (Phase 2) each iteration x↦x+y with y<0 so x decreases by at least 1, making f₂ decrease by ≥1 and remain ≥0.  
Hence the lexicographic pair (f₁,f₂) is a valid 2-phase ranking function proving termination.
