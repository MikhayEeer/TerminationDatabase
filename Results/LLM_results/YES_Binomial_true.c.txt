[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
nested  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
x - n,  
x - k  

The program will terminate because the outer loop iterates with `n` from 0 to `x`, and the inner loop iterates with `k` from 0 to `x`. Therefore, both loops have clear decreasing bounds with respect to `n` and `k`, meaning they will eventually reach the terminating condition. Since both `x` and `y` are non-negative due to checks, the calls to `binomialCoefficient` will perform valid operations and eventually terminate as well.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1st phase: (x - n), for first loop, decreases from x to 0  
2nd phase: (x - k), for second loop, decreases from x to 0  

The main function initializes two non-deterministic integers `x` and `y`, checking for their non-negativity, and then uses a doubly nested loop to iterate. The outer loop decrements `n` from `x` to `0`, and for each iteration of `n`, the inner loop decrements `k` from `x` to `0`. This nested loop ensures decrements toward zero, thus proving termination using a multi-phase ranking function.
