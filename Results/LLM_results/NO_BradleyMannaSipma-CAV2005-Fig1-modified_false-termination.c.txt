NONTERM
[REASON]
If one argument is zero and the other is positive (e.g. y1>0, y2=0), then y1=y1âˆ’y2 leaves y1 unchanged and the loop never terminates.

[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
If one argument is zero and the other positive (e.g. y1=0, y2>0), each subtraction leaves the pair unchanged, so the loop never terminates.
