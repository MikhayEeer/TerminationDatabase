[REASON]  
Possible increments to `x` can keep it non-negative indefinitely.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program is non-terminating because it's possible for the value of `x` to never become negative. The `__VERIFIER_nondet_int()` can return non-positive values, which would prevent the condition `x >= 0` from ever failing.
