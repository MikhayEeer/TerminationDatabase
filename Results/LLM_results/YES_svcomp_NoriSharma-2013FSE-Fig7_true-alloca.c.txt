[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
0.5 * (M - i) + 0.5 * (N - j)

The program is terminating because the increments of `*i` and `*j` within the loop ensure that both increment towards `*M` and `*N` respectively. Each iteration of the loop strictly decreases the sum of the distances to `*M` and `*N`, thus leading to termination.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The loop condition `(*i < *M || *j < *N)` can always be true if `*M` and `*N` are set to values larger than the initial values of `*i` and `*j`. The program does not ensure that the loop exits, hence it is non-terminating.
