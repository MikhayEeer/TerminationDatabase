=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The loop condition `*i < *M || *j < *N` allows the possibility that only one of `*i` or `*j` will increase until it exceeds `*M` or `*N`. If either `*M` or `*N` is sufficiently large (or not properly initialized), the loop may run indefinitely, thus making the program non-terminating.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
-1.0 *  i^1 + 1.0 *  M^1 
-1.0 *  j^1 + 1.0 *  N^1 

The program is terminating because as the loop executes, the values of `*i` and `*j` are incremented by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, eventually `*i >= *M` and `*j >= *N`, which will break the loop condition `*i < *M || *j < *N`. The linear combination of these differences forms a ranking function that shows the loop is bounded and will eventually terminate.
