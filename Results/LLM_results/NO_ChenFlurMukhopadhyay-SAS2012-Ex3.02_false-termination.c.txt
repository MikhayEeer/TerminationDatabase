=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program contains a loop where if \( x > 0 \), \( y \geq 0 \), and \( z \geq 0 \), both \( x \) and \( y \) can increase indefinitely due to the operations \( x = x + y \) and \( y = y + z \). Thus, the loop can potentially execute infinitely without reaching a termination condition.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
x increases indefinitely with non-negative y and z, causing an infinite loop when x starts positive.
