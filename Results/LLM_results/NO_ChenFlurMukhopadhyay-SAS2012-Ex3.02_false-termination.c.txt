NONTERM
[REASON]
There exists an infinite execution: if x>0, yâ‰¥0, zâ‰¥0 then y and z never decrease so x_{n+1}=x_n+y_n stays >0 forever and the loop never exits.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
For example, with x=1, y=0, z=0 we have x:=x+y=1, y:=y+z=0 at each iteration, so x remains >0 forever and the loop never terminates.
