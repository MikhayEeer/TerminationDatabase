=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
f(s) = end − s

Here, “end” denotes the address of the terminating ‘\0’ in the input string.  On each loop iteration s advances by one, so f(s) decreases by exactly 1 and stays non‐negative, hence it is a valid linear ranking function proving termination.

[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
f(s) = end_ptr – s

Explanation of the ranking function:
• end_ptr is the (constant) address of the terminating '\0' in the buffer  
• s is the loop‐pointer in cstrchr  
• On each iteration s increments by 1, so f(s) decreases by exactly 1  
• When s == end_ptr, f(s)=0 and the loop exits  
• f(s) is always a non‐negative integer and strictly decreases, hence it is a valid linear ranking function proving termination.
