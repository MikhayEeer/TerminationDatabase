=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
0.5 * i^1 + 0.5 * 1

Explanation: The program will terminate because for any initial integer value of `i`, the value of `i` is continuously decreased by 2 in each loop iteration. This ensures that `i` will eventually become either 1 or 0, leading to the exit from the loop. The ranking function `0.5 * i + 0.5` is a linear ranking function that decreases with each iteration, ensuring termination.
