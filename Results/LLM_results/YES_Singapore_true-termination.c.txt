2.0 * x^1 + 1.0 * y^1 + 0.0 * 1

Explanation of the ranking function f(x,y)=2x+y:
  - In every state entering the loop we have x>0 and x+y≤0, so f(x,y)=2x+y ≥2x−x = x >0.
  - After an iteration x′=2x+y, y′=y−1, so
      f(x′,y′)−f(x,y) = (2x′+y′)−(2x+y) = (4x+3y−1)−(2x+y) = 2(x+y)−1 ≤ −1.
  Hence f decreases by at least 1 each loop iteration and is bounded below by 0, proving termination.

[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi‐phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
Phase 1: 1.0 * y  
Phase 2: 1.0 * x  

Explanation:  
– In every loop iteration y is decremented (y' = y–1), so Phase 1’s measure strictly decreases until the point y<–x.  
– Once y<–x holds, x′=2x+y< x, so Phase 2’s measure x strictly decreases.  
Together these two phases form a well‐founded, multi‐phase ranking function proving termination.
