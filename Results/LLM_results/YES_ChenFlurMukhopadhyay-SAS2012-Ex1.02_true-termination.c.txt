[RANKING FUNCTION]  
While the program is terminating, it can be witnessed by considering a linear ranking function by observing the conditions within the loop. The key condition is:

- `x` has to satisfy `x > 0 && x < 100`.

The crucial part is the `if` statement, which causes the loop to break if `x < 2*old_x + 10`. This condition ensures that either:
1. The loop will break due to a newly assigned value of `x` that satisfies the inequality, thus eventually terminating.
2. The original condition (`x > 0 && x < 100`) will not hold if the loop doesn't break and an assignment to `x` was made that made it invalid.

Thus, over non-increasing steps that do not satisfy the condition, the program will terminate. The function comparing the current and previous value of `x` can be represented as `f(x) = 2 * old_x + 10 - x`, which acts as a potential ranking function under a linear perspective. Each successful iteration that cannot lead to abuse in the break condition leads to a decrement in the effective space potential between `old_x` and `x`.

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
f(x) = 100 - x  

Explanation: The loop terminates because the condition `x > 0 && x < 100` indicates that `x` starts within this range. If the non-deterministic assignment to `x` inside the loop does not meet the condition `x < 2*old_x + 10`, it breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, the value of `x` remains bounded and the loop guard eventually fails, ensuring termination. The linear ranking function `100 - x` decreases to zero when `x` reaches 100, providing a linear measure that shows the loop terminates.
