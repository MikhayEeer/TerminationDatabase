99 - x

This program is terminating. The linear ranking function `99 - x` decreases with each iteration of the loop because the loop is broken whenever the new `x` is not sufficiently large (i.e., when `x < 2*old_x + 10`). Consequently, the program does not continue indefinitely, ensuring termination.

f(x) = 101 - x  

Explanation:  
The program consists of a loop where the variable `x` is updated with a nondeterministic integer each iteration. However, within the loop, there is a `break` statement that is executed if `x` satisfies the condition `x < 2*old_x + 10`. Given the constraints `x > 0` and `x < 100`, the loop will terminate if it eventually satisfies the break condition or if `x` exits the defined range, resulting in the termination of the loop. The linear ranking function `f(x) = 101 - x` decreases as `x` approaches 100, thereby proving termination.
