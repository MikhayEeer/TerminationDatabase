[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * x^1 + 1.0
-1.0 * z^1 + 1.0 * y^1 + 1.0

Explanation: The program is terminating because the sequence of operations in the loop eventually causes `x` to become negative due to the influence of `z` being alternately subtracted and incremented by 1, and these dynamics ensure the loop exits. The multi-phase ranking function ensures the decrease of the loop metric over two phases.
