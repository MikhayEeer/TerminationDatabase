r(x,y,z) = (z + 1)² + 2·x

Explanation:
  On each loop‐iteration
    x′ = x + y,      y′ = z,      z′ = –z – 1
  so
    r′
    = (z′+1)² + 2·x′
    = (–z–1+1)² + 2·(x+y)
    = (–z)² + 2x + 2y
    = z² + 2x + 2y
    = (z+1)² + 2x  – 1      (since y = z in the loop)
    = r – 1.
  Moreover, while x ≥ 0 (the loop‐condition) we have r(x,y,z) = (z+1)² + 2x ≥ 0, so r is a well‐founded non-negative integer function that strictly decreases by 1 each iteration. Hence the loop terminates.

[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
piecewise
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
– For states with z ≥ 0:  
   R₁(x,y,z) = 2·x + z + 1  
– For states with z < 0:  
   R₂(x,y,z) = 2·x − z  

[EXPLANATION]
Partitioning by the sign of z gives two linear ranking functions.  One checks that whenever z ≥ 0 the next state has z′ = −z−1 < 0 (so we switch to R₂), and whenever z < 0 the next state has z′ = −z−1 ≥ 0 (so we switch back to R₁), and in each case the corresponding R‐function drops by at least 1.  Since x ≥ 0 throughout the loop ensures R₁,R₂ stay non-negative, this piecewise ranking proves termination.
