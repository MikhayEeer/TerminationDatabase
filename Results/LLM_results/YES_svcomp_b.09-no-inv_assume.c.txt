[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
piecewise
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * x^1 for x > y
1.0 * x^1 for x <= y

The program terminates as the `while` loop in the function `test_fun` will eventually break, regardless of the initial conditions of `x` and `y`, as either `x` is being decreased or set to `y` which is less than or equal to `x`.

[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
x

Explanation:
- The termination of the program can be demonstrated by observing the linear decrement of the variable `x`. 
- The program enters the while loop only if `x` is not zero and `x > 0`, `y > 0`.
- Within the loop body:
  - If `x > y`, `x` is assigned the value of `y`, which makes `x` less than or equal to its previous value.
  - Otherwise, `x` is decreased by 1.
- Thus, the value of `x` is non-increasing in the loop and will eventually reach zero, leading to the termination of the loop.
- Therefore, `x` serves as a valid linear ranking function, proving the program terminates.
