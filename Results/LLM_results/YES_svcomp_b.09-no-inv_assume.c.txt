The function `test_fun` terminates because in each iteration of the `while` loop, the value of `x` is strictly decreasing by either setting it to `y` when `x > y` (which will lead to the value of `x` decreasing as x gets assigned the value of `y`, which is less than `x`), or by decrementing `x` by 1 when `x <= y`. The piecewise ranking function relies on `x` being decremented in every step of the loop, which guarantees eventual termination once `x` reaches 0.
