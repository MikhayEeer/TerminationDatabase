[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * x + 0.0 * y + 0.0  
Explanation: In each loop iteration x is replaced by either y (when x>y) or x−1 (when x≤y), and since y<x in the first case and x−1<x in the second, the linear function f(x,y)=x strictly decreases and is bounded below by 0.
