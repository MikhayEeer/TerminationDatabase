Explanation: The program is guaranteed to terminate because the inner loop decreases the value of both `*x_ref` and `*y_ref` by 1 in each iteration as long as `*y_ref` is greater than 0. Once `*y_ref` reaches 0, the inner loop terminates, and since the condition for the outer loop requires `*x_ref` to be equal to `*y_ref` which is now 0, the outer loop will not continue executing. Therefore, the program is terminating, and the ranking function for the inner loop is `y`, which decreases with every iteration. After exiting the inner loop, if reached, the outer loop would consist of `x`, but since it doesn't re-enter, it simply terminates.
