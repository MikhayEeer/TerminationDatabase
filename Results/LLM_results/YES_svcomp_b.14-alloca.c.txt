linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * x_ref + 1.0 * y_ref

Explanation: Under the loop guard (*x_ref == *y_ref && *x_ref > 0) we have x_ref+y_ref = 2Â·x_ref > 0, and each iteration of the (nested) inner loop decrements both *x_ref and *y_ref by 1 until they reach 0, so x_ref+y_ref strictly decreases from a positive value to 0, proving termination.
