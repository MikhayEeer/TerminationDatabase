Phase 1:  
1.0 * y^1 + 0.0  

Phase 2:  
1.0 * r^1 + 0.0  

Explanation: The program computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. The first phase decreases the absolute value of `y` with each iteration of the outer while loop until it reaches zero. The second phase involves the inner while loop, which decreases `r` until it becomes less than `y`, effectively bringing us to the end of the iteration of the outer loop. Each phase guarantees a decrease in non-negative integer values, proving termination.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
Phase 1: \( 1.0 * y^1 \)
Phase 2: \( 1.0 * (x \mod y)^1 \)

Explanation: The program effectively computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. The outer loop decreases the positive integer \( y \), which ensures termination. Within the loop, the reduction of \( x \mod y \) to a value less than \( y \) determines the next phase, ensuring termination at each step. The multi-phase ranking function formalizes this decrease, indicating that the process will eventually reach 0, at which point the loops will terminate.
