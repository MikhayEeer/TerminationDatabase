=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * x + 0.0 * y

Explanation:
For each loop iteration, x is replaced by either y (when x>y) or x−1 (when x≤y). In the first case x>y⇒new x=y<old x, in the second new x=old x−1<old x. Hence the linear function f(x,y)=x is a valid ranking function that decreases by at least 1 each iteration and is bounded below by 0.
