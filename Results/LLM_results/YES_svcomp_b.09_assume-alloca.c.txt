[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
If `x_ref` > `y_ref`: 
  Decrease `x_ref` to `y_ref`. The function proceeds to terminate as `x_ref` eventually becomes `0` or negative.

Else:
  Primary phase reducing via `x_ref = x_ref - 1`, ensuring `x_ref` decreases until zero is reached.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program can enter into an infinite loop if `y > 0` initially and remains positive, with `x` and `y` such that `x > y` or `x > 0` continually decreasing `x` by one without ever reaching zero.
