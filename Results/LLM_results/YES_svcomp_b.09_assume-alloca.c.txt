For the loop with condition `*x_ref == 0`:  
- If `*x_ref > *y_ref`, then `*x_ref` changes to `*y_ref`, which is non-increasing and bounded below by 0.
- If `*x_ref <= *y_ref` and `*x_ref > 0`, `*x_ref` decreases by 1.  

The nested ranking function for this situation can be seen as:  
1. Decrease `*x_ref` to 0 while it is positive.  
2. The loop terminates when `*x_ref` reaches 0.  

Hence, using a lexicographic tuple with the components being non-negative will decrease:  
1. `< *x_ref >` when `*x_ref` is positive and `*x_ref <= *y_ref`.   
2. This exhibits progress as `*x_ref` becomes zero or stays non-positive post condition check.
