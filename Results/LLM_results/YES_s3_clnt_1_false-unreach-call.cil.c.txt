[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program contains a loop with a series of state transitions that can potentially cycle indefinitely, as the state transitions depend on non-deterministic values provided by `__VERIFIER_nondet_int()`. This can result in infinite loops without a guarantee of termination.
