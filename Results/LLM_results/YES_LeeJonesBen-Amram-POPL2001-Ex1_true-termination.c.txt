[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
0.5 * ls^2 + 0.5 * ls^1  
1 * ls^1 + 0 * 1 

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
lexicographic
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1. Primary component: ls (decreases) 
2. Secondary component: a (increases but bounded by ls)

[EXPLANATION]
The program terminates because the primary parameter `ls` in function `r1` strictly decreases by 1 in each recursive call and it is initially non-negative. Although `a` increases, it's secondary and bounded by `ls`. Once `ls` reaches zero, the recursion stops, ensuring termination.
