[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
The main function contains a condition `if (ls >= 0)` which filters for non-negative values of `ls`. When this condition is satisfied, the `rev` function is called, which in turn calls the `r1` function with `ls` and `0`.

The `r1` function decrements the first argument `ls` in the recursive call (`r1(ls-1, ls+1+a)`) until it becomes `0`. Since `ls` is non-negative at the start, it will eventually reach `0`, which leads to a base case that returns a constant value `a`. This ensures that the recursion will terminate.

The ranking function can be described as:
- Primary: `ls`, decreases with each recursive call by `1` until it hits `0`.
