1. For `rec1(i)` function: 
   - Ranking function is \( i \) which decreases by at least 2 after each recursive call until it is non-positive.
  
2. For `rec2(j)` function: 
   - Ranking function is \( j \) which decreases by at least 1 with each recursive call, reducing it to eventually reach non-positive values. 
   
These ranking functions demonstrate the decrease in argument values for both recursive function calls, ensuring termination.

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
For `rec1(int i)`:   
The ranking function is i, as each recursive call to `rec1` ultimately decreases the argument i by at least 1 before reaching a base case.  

For `rec2(int j)`:  
The ranking function is j, as after invoking `rec1`, which is terminating, the function `rec2` further decrements the argument j by 1 until reaching a base case.
