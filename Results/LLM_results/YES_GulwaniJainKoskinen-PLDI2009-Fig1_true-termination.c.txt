1. When `tmp <= maxId`:  
   - Ranking Function: `maxId - tmp`  
   - This value decreases with each iteration, as `tmp` increases by 1, moving towards `maxId`.  
2. When `tmp > maxId`:  
   - The loop condition resets `tmp` to `0`, which makes `tmp != id` eventually false once the conditions are no longer met.

This piecewise function shows that under the given conditions, the loop eventually terminates.
