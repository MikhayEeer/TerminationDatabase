Phase 1: r₁(a,b) = b + 1  
Phase 2: r₂(a,b) = a + 1

Explanation of the phases:
• Phase 1 applies whenever b ≥ 0.  In one step we do b′ = −b−1, so r₁′ = (−b−1)+1 = −b ≤ 0, hence r₁ strictly goes to 0 or below and we immediately enter Phase 2.  
• Phase 2 applies whenever b < 0.  Then a′ = a + b ≤ a−1, so r₂′ = (a + b) + 1 ≤ a < a + 1 = r₂, i.e. r₂ strictly decreases by at least 1 each iteration in Phase 2, and since r₂ is bounded below by 1 as long as a ≥ 0, it must eventually reach 0 and force a < 0, terminating the loop.

a + b + 1
a + 1

Explanation sketch (for your reference):  
– When b ≥ 0, one iteration sends (a,b)↦(a+b, –b–1), and a + b + 1 strictly decreases by 1.  
– When b < 0, one iteration sends (a,b)↦(a+b, –b), and a + 1 strictly decreases (since b < 0 ⇒ a+b < a).  
Together these two “phases” prove that the loop must eventually drive a < 0 and terminate.
