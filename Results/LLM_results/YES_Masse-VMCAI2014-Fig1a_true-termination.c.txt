The program terminates because the value of `a` decreases consistently each time the loop executes, due to the operation `a = a + b` and the transformations on `b`. Specifically, when `b` is non-negative, it becomes negative, ensuring the overall decrease of `a`. When `b` is negative, it flips to a positive, which is effectively mitigated by the overall decrease from the previous state. Consequently, `a` will eventually become negative, terminating the loop. This behavior can be proven using a multi-phase ranking function based solely on `a`.
