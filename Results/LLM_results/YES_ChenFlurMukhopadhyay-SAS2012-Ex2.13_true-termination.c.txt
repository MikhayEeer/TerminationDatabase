=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * (x - y)^1   
This ranking function decreases with each loop iteration as `x` and `y` are updated such that `x - y` decreases. Since `1.0 * (x - y)^1` is bounded and decreases, the loop is guaranteed to terminate.
