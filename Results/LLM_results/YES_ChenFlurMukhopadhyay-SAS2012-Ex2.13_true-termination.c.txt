=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
non-linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
T(x, y) = ((x - y)^2) + 1

The program is terminating as the expression \((x - y)^2\) strictly decreases in each iteration of the loop until the condition \(x - y > 0\) is no longer satisfied.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * (x - y)^1  
This ranking function shows that the program will eventually terminate as the expression (x - y) is decreased in each iteration of the loop, guaranteeing that it will eventually become non-positive, causing the loop to terminate.
