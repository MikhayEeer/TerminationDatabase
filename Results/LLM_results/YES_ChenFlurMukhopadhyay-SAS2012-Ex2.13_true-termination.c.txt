Phase 1: f₁(x,y) = −1.0 * x + 0.0 * y + −1.0  
Phase 2: f₂(x,y) = 1.0 * x + −1.0 * y + 1.0  

Explanation of phases:  
– Phase 1 (active when x<−1): f₁(x,y)=−x−1≥1 and in each two‐step cycle x↦x+1 so f₁ decreases by 1 until x≥−1.  
– Phase 2 (starts when x≥−1 and loop guard x>y still holds): f₂(x,y)=x−y+1≥2 and after one iteration x↦y−x,y↦y+1 makes x−y decrease by 1, driving f₂ to ≤0 and exiting the loop.
