f₁(x,y,z,i) = y − x
f₂(x,y,z,i) = max(x − z, 0)

Explanation of decrease each iteration under lex order (f₁,f₂):
- If z > x then x increases by 1 ⇒ f₁ = y−x decreases by 1 (f₂ irrelevant).
- If z ≤ x then z increases by 1 ⇒ x−z decreases by 1 while f₁ stays the same.
Thus (f₁,f₂) strictly decreases in the lexicographic order on ℕ×ℕ.
