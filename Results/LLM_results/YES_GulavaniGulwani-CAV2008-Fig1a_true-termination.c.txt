1.0 * y^1 + -1.0 * x^1


=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTION]
y - x

This ranking function shows that the loop terminates. The value \( y - x \) decreases by 1 with each iteration of the loop, as either \( x \) increases or \( z \) increases, neither of which can increase enough to make \( x = y \). As \( y \) is constant and \( x \) is incremented, when \( x \) becomes equal to \( y \), the loop terminates.
