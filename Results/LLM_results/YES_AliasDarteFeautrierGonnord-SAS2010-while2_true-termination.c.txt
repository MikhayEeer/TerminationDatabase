=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
lexicographic
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * i^1
1.0 * j^1

The provided program is terminating, and this can be proven using a lexicographic ranking function. The outer loop, which decrements `i`, guarantees that the first component of the lexicographic tuple will eventually reach zero. Within each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop decrements `j` from `N` to zero, ensuring the second component decreases and terminates before another iteration of the outer loop begins. Thus, the program always makes progress toward termination.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * i^1 + 1.0 * 1  
1.0 * j^1 + 1.0 * 1  

This program is terminating. The outer loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which decreases with every iteration, ensuring termination. For each fixed value of `i`, the inner loop is controlled by the variable `j`, which also decreases with each iteration of the inner loop and resets back to `N` when `i` is decremented. This ensures that for every complete execution of the inner loop, `i` decreases, eventually reaching 0, thus causing the program to terminate. The ranking functions provided show a multi-phase decrease that accounts for the decrease in both `i` and `j`.
