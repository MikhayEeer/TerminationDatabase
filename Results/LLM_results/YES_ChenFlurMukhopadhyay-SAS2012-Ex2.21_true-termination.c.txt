[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
0.5 * x^2 + 1.5 * y^2 + 3.0 * 1  
0.5 * y^2 + 1.5 * 1

The program is terminating because the sequence formed by the value of `x` and the alternating flipping and decrementing of `y` ensures that `x` will eventually become non-positive, thus ending the loop. The ranking function decreases with each iteration of the loop.
