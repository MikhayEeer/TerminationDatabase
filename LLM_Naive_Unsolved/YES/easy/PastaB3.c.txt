=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The inner loop `while (x > y)` is non-terminating as `y = x + y` will always increase `y` when `x > y`, and thus the condition `x > y` will remain true if initially `x > y`.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program can enter an infinite loop if `x` is greater than `y` initially. In this case, `y` gets updated by adding `x` and `y` in each iteration, which will always satisfy the loop condition `x > y`, thereby leading to non-termination.
