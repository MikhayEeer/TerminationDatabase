=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The variable `y` is incremented unconditionally in the loop, which could repeatedly increase `y` indefinitely without making `x > y` false, if `x` is a large value or also increasing.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program is non-terminating because if `x` is initialized to a value greater than `y`, the loop `while (x > y)` will continue indefinitely as `y` is incremented, but `x` remains unchanged, leading to an infinite execution when `x` > `y`.
