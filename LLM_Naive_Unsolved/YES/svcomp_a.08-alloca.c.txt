NONTERM
[REASON]
The values of `*x_ref` and `*y_ref` increase without bound due to the updates `*x_ref = *x_ref + 1` and `*y_ref = *y_ref + 2`, potentially causing the loop to run indefinitely when the initial condition `*x_ref > *y_ref` is met and continues to be true no matter how large the values grow.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The values of *x_ref and *y_ref increase at every iteration, so if initially *x_ref > *y_ref, the condition *x_ref > *y_ref will remain true, resulting in an infinite loop.
