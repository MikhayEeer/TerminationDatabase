=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program can enter an infinite loop in the `search` function if the value `m` is not found in the list. Given the nondeterministic nature of `n`, `m`, and `start`, the list may not contain the value `m`, especially if the computed target `start + m` does not exist in the initialized list.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program may enter an infinite loop in the `search` function if `m` is not in the list. Since `m` is nondeterministically chosen, there are scenarios where the program will keep traversing the list without finding the target value, leading to non-termination.
