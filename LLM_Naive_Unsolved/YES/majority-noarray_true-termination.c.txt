=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
An adversarial nondet scheduler can never pick or drive the attr transition for agent 2, leaving I(2,0)=1 forever so the exit test (I(2,0)∈{0,2}) never becomes true.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
Because both the agent‐selection and next‐pc choices are nondeterministic, one can forever avoid the pc‐states (6 or 11) that set an agent’s I to the even value 2.  As a result at least one I remains odd (1 or 3) indefinitely, so the exit‐condition (all I in {0,2}) never holds.
