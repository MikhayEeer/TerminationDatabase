=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
linear
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * n^1 + -2.0 * 1

This ranking function m(n)=n−2 is strictly positive when n≥3 and decreases by 1 on each mutual call (f↔f2), ensuring termination.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
Each call to f or f2 eventually invokes __VERIFIER_error(), an external function presumed non-terminating.
