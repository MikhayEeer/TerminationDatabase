[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The recursion in the function `average` can create an infinite loop due to the operations `x-1` and `x+1`, `y+1`, `y-2`. This allows the function to potentially cycle between cases indefinitely without decreasing to a base case, especially since conditions allow balancing the increase and decrease, leading to potentially infinite recursion if certain initial conditions are met.
