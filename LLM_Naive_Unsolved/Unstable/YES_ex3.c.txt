[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
The functions `rec1` and `rec2` have separate ranking functions based on recursive depth reduction.

For `rec1`, the ranking function is based on the decreasing depth of recursion on `i`:
- Ranking function for `rec1`: The parameter `i` strictly decreases with each recursive call until it reaches `0` or less, at which point the recursion terminates.

For `rec2`, the ranking function is based on the transformation through calls to `rec1`:
- Ranking function for `rec2`: The combination of `rec2` and `rec1` ensure that every recursive call chain makes progress towards termination by reducing the input in a structured manner.

Hence both functions will eventually reach their base cases and terminate.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The function `rec2` calls `rec1` with an argument `j+1`, causing `rec2` to repeatedly call itself with a non-terminating recursive pattern when `j` is positive.
