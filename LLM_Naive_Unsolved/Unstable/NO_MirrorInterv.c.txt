=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1.0 * range^1 + 1.0 * i^1 + 20.0 * 1  
0.5 * range^1 + i + 0.5 * 1  

The program is terminating as the range and i collectively ensure that the loop eventually exits. The ranking function first decreases lexicographically and then ensures termination as either range or i reaches a constraint that exits the loop.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON] 
The variable `range` can increase indefinitely in the else block causing the loop to not necessarily terminate, especially since `range` reaching -1 prevents immediate termination due to the condition in the while loop, potentially allowing `i` to oscillate within the bounds without endpoint constraints.
