=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program has a potential infinite loop if `k` is not sufficiently large to offset the incrementing logic involving `i_ref` and `j_ref`. Specifically, if the initial value of `k` is large or negative, the loop could run indefinitely as `j_ref` keeps increasing without a mechanism to consistently satisfy the exit condition `(*j_ref > k)`.
