=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program contains a loop that decreases `x` by `2*y - 1` in each iteration while `x` is non-negative. However, there is no guarantee that `x` will ever become negative as `y` can be any integer, including negative or zero, causing no progress towards termination. Therefore, the loop can potentially run indefinitely.

[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
