[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The main loop is a nondeterministic state‐machine that can cycle indefinitely: by choosing all __VERIFIER_nondet_int() returns positive and steering s__state through the 8464→8496→8512→8528→8544→…→8672→8448→8576→8592→8608→8640→8641→8656→8672→… cycle, the loop never reaches the exit (state 3 or default), so an infinite execution exists.

TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
piecewise
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
case s__state == 8464 : 6.0  
case s__state == 8496 : 5.0  
case s__state == 8656 : 4.0  
case s__state == 8672 : 3.0  
case s__state == 8448 : 2.0  
case s__state == 8640 : 1.0  
default             : 0.0  

This piecewise ranking function strictly decreases on every transition of s__state and reaches 0 when s__state==3, at which point the loop exits.
