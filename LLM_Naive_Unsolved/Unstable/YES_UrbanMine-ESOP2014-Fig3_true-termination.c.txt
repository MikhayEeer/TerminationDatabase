[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
f₀(x,y) = |x|
f₁(x,y) = y

Explanation of the proof obligations (not part of the required output): under every loop‐transition either |x| strictly decreases, or else |x| stays non‐zero and y strictly decreases. Since the loop guard is “x≠0 ∧ y>0,” when |x| reaches 0 the loop exits immediately, and if |x| stays positive then y cannot decrease forever without eventually hitting y≤0 and exiting. Hence the nested pair (|x|,y) is a valid ranking.

[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
An adversarial choice cycle lets x and y be reset to arbitrarily large positives: from x<0 take the branch x=⟂ (nondet≫0), y–; then in x>0 take the branch x–, y=⟂ (nondet≫0). Repeating this keeps x≠0 and y>0 forever.
