[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
Phase 1: |x|  
Phase 2: y  

Explanation of the proof sketch:  
– In Phase 1 we show that every iteration in which x≠0 strictly decreases |x| (by 1) whatever happens to y, until eventually x reaches 0 and the loop guard (*x != 0) fails.  
– If instead x becomes 0 before y≤0, the loop also exits immediately.  
– In the case that x starts at 0 the loop never executes.  
– The only other way to exit is by driving y down to 0 or below, which is captured in Phase 2 by the second ranking function y, which decreases by 1 in every iteration that does not yet force x to 0.  
Together these two phases form a well‐founded descent showing that no infinite execution is possible.

[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
Under adversarial nondet choices one can keep *x alternating between 1 and 0 while preserving *y>0 (by in the *x>0 branch always taking the path “*x= *x–1; *y=nondet” with a positive value, and in the *x<=0 branch always taking “*x = *x+1”), so the loop condition stays true forever.
