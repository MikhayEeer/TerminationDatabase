=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program can enter a loop where the state oscillates indefinitely, such as transitioning between the states (x = 1, y = 2) and (x = 2, y = 1).

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi-phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
x + y
x - 1

The program is terminating. The multi-phase ranking function explains that in each phase of the loop execution, the sum of `x` and `y` decreases in a well-founded manner, as well as `x` itself decreases independently after the first phase, ensuring termination.
