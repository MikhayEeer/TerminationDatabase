f(x, a, b) = x  

The program is terminating. The ranking function `f(x, a, b) = x` shows that the value of `x` will decrease in every loop iteration when `b == a`, eventually making `x` negative and exiting the loop. The loop invariant `b >= a` is trivially satisfied when `a == b`.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program is non-terminating because if `a = b`, the update `x = x + a - b - 1` simplifies to `x = x - 1`, which leads to an infinite loop since `x` will keep decreasing and the loop condition `x >= 0` will eventually become false and terminate, unless the initial value of `x` is already negative. However, since the loop condition is `x >= 0`, it will eventually terminate if the initial value of `x` is positive or zero. If `x` starts negative, the loop body won't execute at all. Therefore, the loop can potentially execute infinitely depending on the initial values of `x`, `a`, and `b`, but it will still terminate as described.
