[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
There is an infinite execution if the “then” branch is chosen every time.  For example, start with x₀=y₀=–100, z arbitrary; then each step  
  xₙ₊₁ = xₙ+1,  yₙ₊₁ = yₙ + xₙ+1  
keeps xₙ ≥ yₙ and makes yₙ more negative, so the loop guard x ≥ y always holds and the loop never terminates.

[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
multi‐phase
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
1.0 * z^1 + 1.0 * 1
1.0 * x^1 + -1.0 * y^1 + 1.0 * 1

Explanation of the phases:
- Phase 1 (while z ≥ 0): the measure R₁ = z+1 is a natural‐number ranking that decreases on every “false” iteration (z→z−1) and never increases on “true” iterations.
- Once z<0 we enter Phase 2: the measure R₂ = x−y+1 is nonnegative exactly as long as the loop guard (x≥y) holds, and on every iteration (both branches) x−y strictly decreases until x<y and the loop exits.
