=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The helper multiple_of(n,m) does not terminate when m>0 and n mod m≠0 (it bounces between positive and negative n). Since is_prime_(n,n−1) always calls multiple_of(n,n−1) for n>2 with n mod (n−1)=1, the recursion never returns, making the program non-terminating.
