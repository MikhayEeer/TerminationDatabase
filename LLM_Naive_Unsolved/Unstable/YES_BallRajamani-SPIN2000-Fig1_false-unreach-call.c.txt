[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  

[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
piecewise  

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
– Case a1 ≠ 0 : 1.0  
– Case a1 = 0 : 0.0  

[EXPLANATION]  
In the only recursive call  
    A(a1,a2) → if a1 ≠ 0 then A(a2,a1)  
the piecewise function  
    f(a1,a2) = (a1 ≠ 0 ? 1 : 0)  
strictly decreases from 1 in the caller to 0 in the callee. Once a1 = 0 the recursion stops. Hence every call tree is finite and the whole program terminates.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
For initial g=0, h=1: first call sets g=1, second call A(1,1) recurses infinitely (A(1,1) → A(1,1) → …).
