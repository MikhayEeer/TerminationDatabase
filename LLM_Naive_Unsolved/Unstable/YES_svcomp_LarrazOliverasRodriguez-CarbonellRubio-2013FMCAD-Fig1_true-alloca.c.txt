[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
1. *y (for the outer loop)  
1. *z - *y (for the inner loop)  

The program is terminating as it has a nested loop structure. The decrement of *y in the outer loop eventually causes the loop to terminate, while the inner loop also decreases with the ranking function *z - *y, ensuring both loops will eventually exit.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The loop involving variables `*x`, `*y`, and `*z` can cause the program not to terminate due to the possibility of an infinite increase in `*y` or entering an infinite inner loop, specifically with particular values of `*x`, `*y`, and `*z` that prevent the exit condition `*y < *z` from ever being false or resetting conditions leading to an indefinite loop.
