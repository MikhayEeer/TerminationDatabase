nested  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
The function `g` has a nested recursion with a ranking function:  
if \( x = 0 \), then it terminates immediately.  
if \( x > 0 \), the function calls itself with \( g(x-1) \), and \( x \) decreases due to the call to \( g(x - 1) \). Subsequently, when \( g(x - 1) \) terminates, it calls \( g \) with an even smaller argument, thus creating nested calls.  
This ensures that the deeply nested recursive calls will eventually bottom out once \( x \) reaches zero in the innermost call, ensuring termination.
