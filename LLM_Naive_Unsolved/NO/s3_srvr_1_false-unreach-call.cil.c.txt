Explanation: the loop in ssl3_accept traverses a fixed finite sequence of “state” values  
8464→8496→8512→8528→8544→8560→8448→8576→8592→8608→8640→8656→8672→8448→3,  
and then exits.  At each transition the piecewise constant ranking strictly decreases, establishing termination.

[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
8673.0 + -1.0 * s__state^1  

Explanation: In each iteration through the big switch, the program’s state variable s__state follows a strict acyclic progression over the finite set {8464,8496,8512,8528,8544,8560,8576,8592,8608,8640,8656,8672,8673} before reaching state 3 and exiting.  The function f(s__state)=8673–s__state is non‐negative on all these states and strictly decreases at every transition, proving termination.
