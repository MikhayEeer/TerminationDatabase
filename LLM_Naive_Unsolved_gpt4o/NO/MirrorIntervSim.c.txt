- For the case when `-5 <= i && i < 0`: ranking function is `-5 - i`  
- For the case when `0 <= i <= 35`: ranking function is `i`  
- For the case when `i > 35`: direct transition to `i = 0` reduces `i` immediately

[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
piecewise  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
- For the case when `-5 <= i <= 35`: the ranking function is `i`.
- For the case when `i < -5` or `i > 35`: the ranking function is constant as `0`.  

Explanation:  
The program has a piecewise structure where:

1. If the value of `i` falls within `-5` and `35`, `i` is decremented, bounded by setting `i` to `-5` at the lower end and to `35` at the upper end, thereby ensuring termination as eventually `i` will reach `0`.
2. If `i` falls outside the range `-5` to `35`, it is immediately set to `0`, ensuring termination.  

Thus, the program uses a piecewise strategy to systematically reach termination.
