=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The loop condition `*x >= *y` can remain true indefinitely due to the adjustments of `*x` and `*y` inside the loop. The variable `*x` can increase by `*z - 1` when `*z > 1`, which may cause `*x` to grow rapidly. Additionally, `*y` can increment by 1 when `*z` is not greater than 1; this fluctuation of `*x` and `*y`, especially with control over `*z`, prevents the guarantee of termination.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program is non-terminating because there is a potential for an infinite increase in the value of `*x` relative to `*y`, specifically when `*z > 1`, resulting in `*x` being incremented by `*z` in an unbounded manner, thus maintaining the loop condition `*x >= *y` indefinitely.
