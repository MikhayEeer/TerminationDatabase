If `z` is assigned a value larger than `y`, the condition `x < y` can remain true indefinitely, causing the loop to run eternally without reaching termination.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program contains a loop where `x` is incremented but `y` is reset to the value of `z` in each iteration. Depending on the initial values, `x` may never reach or exceed `y`, leading to a potential infinite loop if `z` is set in such a way that the condition `x < y` always holds.
