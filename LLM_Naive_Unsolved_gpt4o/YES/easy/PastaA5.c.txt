[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The loop condition `x >= y + 1` will remain true indefinitely if `x` is fixed and greater than or equal to `y`'s initial value plus one, because `y` is incremented in each iteration without any change to `x`. Thus, the loop may not terminate if `x` and `y` are initialized such that `x > y + 1`.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program enters an infinite loop if x is initially greater than y, as y is continually incremented without any upper bound or change to x that would exit the loop.
