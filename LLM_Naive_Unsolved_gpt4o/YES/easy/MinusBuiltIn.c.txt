[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The loop condition `x > y` can never be false since `y` is set to `x + 1` inside the loop, making `x > y` always true.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program is non-terminating because inside the loop, the condition `x > y` always becomes true again after executing `y = x + 1`, as the value of `y` is repeatedly set to a value greater than `x`, causing the loop condition to always evaluate to true.
