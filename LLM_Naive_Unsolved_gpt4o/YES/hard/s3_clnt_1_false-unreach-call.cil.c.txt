=== Response 1 ===
The program provided is non-terminating. It enters an infinite loop during execution due to complex and tangled logic which continually cycles through various states without a clear termination condition. Given the state transitions and nondeterministic values, it does not naturally progress to any endpoint where it can terminate. 

[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program contains complex state transitions with nondeterministic values that can keep cycling indefinitely without reaching a conclusive exit condition, leading to infinite execution.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program enters a loop in the `while (1)` block where the state is constantly being checked and modified without a guaranteed halting condition. Given the specific set of states and the non-deterministic behavior from functions like `__VERIFIER_nondet_int()`, there exists a possibility where the program may continue to loop indefinitely without reaching a terminating condition, especially since there are numerous transitions based on non-deterministic values and conditions that may keep the loop active. Hence, the program is non-terminating.
