=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program swaps the values of `x` and `y` if `x > y`, which can create an infinite loop if `x` is always greater than `y` after the swap.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program enters an infinite loop when `x > y`. The values of `x` and `y` are swapped indefinitely without a condition to break the loop, making it non-terminating.
