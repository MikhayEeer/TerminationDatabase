=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program contains a loop that depends on non-deterministic assignments to `x` and `y`, leaving open the possibility for the loop's conditions to be satisfied indefinitely. There are no guarantees within the program logic that the variables `x` and `y` will eventually fail the loop conditions, allowing for potentially infinite execution.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program allows for arbitrary reassignment of `x` and `y` within the loop due to the calls to `__VERIFIER_nondet_int()`, which can potentially always satisfy the loop's guard conditions and prevent termination.
