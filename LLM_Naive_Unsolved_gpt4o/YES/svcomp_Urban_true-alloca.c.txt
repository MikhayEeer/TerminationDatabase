=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program can enter a loop where *x alternates between positive and negative values continuously without reaching 0, while *y remains positive. For instance, if *x starts positive and *y starts greater than zero, with carefully chosen nondeterministic values, the loop may never terminate.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program has non-deterministic assignments and can choose random values for `*x` and `*y`, allowing for infinite interactions between branches.
