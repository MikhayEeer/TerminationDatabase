=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The loop is non-terminating because when `i` is initialized to `-5`, the condition `i != -5` will be false, thus the increment `i = i+1` is not executed, and `i` remains `-5` indefinitely, causing the `while` loop condition `i < 0` to be satisfied persistently.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
i + 6

Explanation: The loop condition is `i < 0` and the operation inside the loop is `i = i + 1` when `i != -5`. This means that for any `i < -5`, `i` will eventually reach a value of -5 and continue incrementing until it becomes non-negative. The ranking function `i + 6` is always non-negative and strictly decreases as `i` increments toward zero. Thus, the program is terminating.
