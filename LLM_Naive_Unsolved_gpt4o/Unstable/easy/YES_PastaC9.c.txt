=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The program is non-terminating because there is a path in which the variable `y` can be reset to a positive value from an arbitrary source (`__VERIFIER_nondet_int()`) while `x` is positive, leading to potential infinite execution as the loop condition (`x > 0 && y > 0`) can continuously be satisfied.
