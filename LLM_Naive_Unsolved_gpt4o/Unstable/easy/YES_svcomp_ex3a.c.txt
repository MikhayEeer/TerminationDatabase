=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The value of `x` might oscillate between certain values without reaching a state where the loop condition `(x > 1) && (x < 100)` becomes false, leading to potential non-termination. Specifically, if `x` starts as a small positive integer greater than 1, squaring `x` will quickly result in a value greater than 100, causing non-termination if the value oscillates between two ranges that do not exit the loop.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
piecewise
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
if (x > 1) and (x < 100): 98 - x
if (x <= 1) or (x >= 100): 0

The program is terminating because when the variable `x` is within the range (1, 100), it will eventually exceed this range due to the squaring operation (`x = x*x`) which increases `x` rapidly. Once `x` is no longer within the range, the loop terminates. The piecewise ranking function effectively captures this behavior by showing a decrease in the appropriate domain.
