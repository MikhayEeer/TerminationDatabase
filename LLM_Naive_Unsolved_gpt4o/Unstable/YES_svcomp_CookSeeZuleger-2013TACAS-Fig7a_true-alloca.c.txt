=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program can potentially enter a non-terminating loop due to the use of non-deterministic values from `__VERIFIER_nondet_int()`, which can reset or increase the values of *x, *y, and *d during the execution. This makes it possible for the loop conditions to be satisfied indefinitely.
