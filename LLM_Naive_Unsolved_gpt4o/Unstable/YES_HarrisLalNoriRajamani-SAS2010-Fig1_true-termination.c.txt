1.0 * (x + y)

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The non-termination arises in the loop labeled L2. When x > 0 and y > 0, and in cases where x = x - d decreases x by 1 or 2 but __VERIFIER_nondet_int() keeps choosing a new nondeterministic y that stays positive or the decrement of y - d does not reach zero, the while loop condition x > 0 && y > 0 may still be satisfied indefinitely, leading to non-termination.
