0.0796 *  x^1 + 0.482 * 1 + 0.482 * 1  

Explanation:  
The functions `rec1` and `rec2` involve recursive calls where the argument is decremented. In `rec1`, the argument `i` is decreased by 2, and in `rec2`, it is rearranged with decrements inside `rec1`. Both functions eventually reach a base case when the argument becomes non-positive, triggering termination. The recursive expressions ensure progress towards these base cases, guaranteeing termination for any finite integer input `x`.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The mutual recursion between `rec1` and `rec2` does not guarantee a decrease in the argument values; hence, it can lead to infinite recursion for certain initial values, making the program non-terminating.
