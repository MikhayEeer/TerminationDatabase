First Level: (y1 + y2)  
Second Level (in gcd function loop): (max(y1, y2) - min(y1, y2))  

The program is terminating. The main function initializes `y1` and `y2` with non-negative integers, calls the gcd function, and the loop inside the gcd function will always reduce the larger of `y1` or `y2` by the smaller, which is guaranteed to terminate as it essentially implements the Euclidean algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program is non-terminating when `y1` and `y2` are both zero. The condition `while (y1 != y2)` will be false if both are zero, making the function enter an infinite loop where `y1` and `y2` remain unchanged.
