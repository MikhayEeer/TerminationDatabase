[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
The main loop iterates at most 12 times, thus it is trivially terminating.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The termination condition of the `while` loop in `main` is purely based on a fixed iteration count (`i2 < 12`), and nothing inside the loop ensures termination beyond this fixed count. Additionally, complex state conditions could, in practice, cause the loop to iterate indefinitely if not for the fixed count.
