=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The loop condition `i < a_length` can be repeatedly satisfied with appropriate values of `a[i]`, `a_length`, and `offset` without necessarily reaching the `break` condition, leading to potential non-termination.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
0.5 * a_length^1 - 0.5 * i^1
