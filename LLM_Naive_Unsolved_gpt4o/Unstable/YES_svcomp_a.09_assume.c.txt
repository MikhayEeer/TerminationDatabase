=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The innermost while loop may never terminate if the initial condition x >= z holds and y > 0, as z will keep increasing by positive y, and x remaining constant, maintaining the loop condition indefinitely.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
piecewise
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
If `y <= 0`: the function terminates immediately as it hits a return statement.

Else:   
First Phase:  
Linear ranking function on the while loop condition: `x - z`
(Ranking function decreases since `z` increases with `y`, making `x - z` eventually negative, breaking the loop.) 

These functions show that the program will not run indefinitely given any initial values for `x`, `y`, and `z`.
