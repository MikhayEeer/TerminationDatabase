=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The value of i oscillates between positive and negative values without ever reaching zero, causing the loop to run indefinitely.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
linear  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
|i|  

This program terminates. The absolute value of `i`, denoted |i|, strictly decreases in every iteration of the loop. If i is negative, it becomes positive and larger in magnitude; if i is positive, it becomes negative and larger in magnitude (one step away from zero). Eventually, |i| decrements to zero, at which point the loop exits, guaranteeing termination.
