=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
TERMINATE
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]
piecewise
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]
For i < 0: -i
For i > 0: i

The program is terminating as the value of `i` is monotonically decreasing in each piecewise analyzed section, and it eventually reaches `0`, at which point the loop terminates. The program has a piecewise ranking function due to the different transformations applied to `i` based on whether it is positive or negative. For negative `i`, `-i` is decreasing, and for positive `i`, `i` is decreasing.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
TERMINATE  
[RANKING FUNCTION TYPE]  
multi-phase  
[RANKING FUNCTIONS]  
ABS(2.0 * (i^1))  

Explanation: The given program will terminate because the absolute value of the integer `i` will decrease steadily to zero, either by incrementing it with 2 when it is negative or decrementing by 2 when it is positive. The multi-phase ranking function ABS(2.0 * (i^1)) decreases in each iteration of the loop until `i` reaches zero, causing the loop to terminate.
