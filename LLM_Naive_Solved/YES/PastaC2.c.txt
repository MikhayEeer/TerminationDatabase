=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The outer loop with condition `x >= 0` is incrementing `x` in its body (`x = x + 1`), which means if initially `x` is non-negative, `x` will keep increasing (and remain non-negative), thus the condition always holds, leading to non-termination.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The outer loop increases `x` by 1 then decreases it by 2, causing `x` to increase indefinitely, resulting in infinite execution.
