[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program has a loop `while (*x_ref > *y_ref)`, where `*y_ref` is increased by `*x_ref` in each iteration. If `*x_ref` is positive and initially greater than `*y_ref`, the loop will run indefinitely as `*y_ref` will always be incremented by the same amount, not allowing `*x_ref` to ever become equal to or less than `*y_ref`.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program's while loop condition `*x_ref > *y_ref` does not impose any decreasing constraint on the allocation of `*x_ref` and `*y_ref`. If initially `*x_ref = k` and `*y_ref = 0`, the loop will execute indefinitely as `*y_ref` becomes `*x_ref + *y_ref` with each iteration, and since `k > 0`, the condition `*x_ref > *y_ref` will always remain true.
