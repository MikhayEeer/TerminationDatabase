=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The loop can potentially run indefinitely due to the counterexample scenario where `x` is incremented in the first branch and `z` is decremented in the second branch, allowing `x` to remain larger than or equal to `y`. These changes can prevent termination by maintaining the condition `x >= y`.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are controlled in such a way that `x` can increase indefinitely if `x` is incremented in the first branch of the `if` statement, causing the loop condition `x >= y` to be satisfied repeatedly without guarantee of termination. Additionally, the decrement of `z` does not directly affect termination conditions on `x` and `y`, allowing non-termination scenarios where the condition remains true indefinitely.
