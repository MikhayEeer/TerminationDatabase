=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The loop `while(res < 1)` at the end of `main` will not terminate if `res` is less than 1, which can happen if `i` is a positive integer. This results in a non-terminating program since there is no mechanism to increase `res` or break out of the loop.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The function `rec` always returns a positive number when `i` is positive, making the condition `while(res < 1)` in `main` false but followed by an infinite loop, hence non-terminating.
