=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The function `loop()` is non-terminating as the condition `(b - c >= 1) && (a == c)` will likely be true infinitely many times, permitting the loop to continue indefinitely. With each iteration, `c` increases by at least 1 (since `r` is non-negative), causing `b` to remain constant at 10. Depending on the output of `random()`, the true condition `b - c >= 1` can frequently be satisfied without convergence, leading to potential infinite recursion without a well-defined base case to halt the loop.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The value of `c` always increases and is set to be equal to `a`, while `b` is constantly reset to 10. This results in the condition `(b - c >= 1)` eventually becoming false due to `c` growing larger than `b`, preventing any termination process related to a decrease in `b - c`. The loop conditions allow non-termination as there is no strict decreasing metric guaranteeing the loop ends.
