=== Response 1 ===
[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The program is non-terminating because in each iteration of the loop, both x and y are increased, preserving the invariant x > y. As x increases by 1 and y by 2 in every step, the condition x > y remains true indefinitely, preventing the loop from terminating.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The value of `x` increases by 1 and `y` increases by 2 on each iteration, keeping `x > y` true indefinitely.
