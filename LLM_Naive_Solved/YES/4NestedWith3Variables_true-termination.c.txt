NONTERM
[REASON]
The update (a,b)↦5·rotation makes a grow exponentially and the geometric sum of a’s can outweigh the −1 per loop, so for some initial (a,b,q) the sequence qₙ→+∞ and the loop never terminates.

[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
For example, if initially b=0 and a≥1 then each step a′=3·a, so a_n≥1 for all n and q′=q+a−1≥q. Hence q never drops to ≤0 and the loop runs forever.
