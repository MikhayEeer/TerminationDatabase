[RESULT]
NONTERM
[REASON]
The loop `while (*tmp != *id && __VERIFIER_nondet_int())` can potentially execute indefinitely. Because `*tmp` is incremented and reset to 0, but can fail to meet the `*tmp != *id` condition depending on the values and behavior of `__VERIFIER_nondet_int()`, the program can fall into an infinite loop without a guarantee of termination.

=== Response 2 ===
[RESULT]  
NONTERM  
[REASON]  
The loop can potentially cycle indefinitely if `*maxId` is a large positive number, `*id` is an initial positive integer, and `__VERIFIER_nondet_int()` continues returning true. In such cases, `*tmp` will keep increasing without reaching `*id`, leading to non-termination.
